      "> Here’s a dirty little secret about those expensive, unpopular Trump tax cuts: We’re probably stuck with them for good, because neither party seems to have the political courage to let them lapse. Not the Republicans who supposedly care about fiscal responsibility, and not the Democrats who are on record as hating them.\n",
      "\n",
      ">This past week, more than 70 Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to make permanent the 2017 GOP-passed tax cuts, large chunks of which are scheduled to expire in 2025. The new bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Vern Buchanan (Fla.), credited the original tax cuts for “historic economic growth” and promised more “prosperity” ahead if they’re extended.\n",
      "\n",
      ">The White House, among others, has repeatedly attacked the proposed Trump tax-cut extension. With pretty good reason: At precisely the same time that Republicans are raising a hue-and-cry about federal deficits, they’re proposing a measure that would massively worsen our fiscal challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Extending President Donald Trump’s individual tax cuts in full would add around $3 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, according to various estimates. As President Biden and others have pointed out, this is of a piece with other GOP-endorsed proposals that would widen deficits, such as repealing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and undoing Democrats’ prescription-drug pricing overhaul.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Moreover, extending the Trump tax cuts sounds pretty plutocratic: By far, the biggest benefits would go to higher-income households, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.\n",
      "\n",
      ">There is also little evidence that the 2017 tax law significantly boosted growth, at least based on the investment-driven theories touted by its supporters. It definitely didn’t generate enough economic growth to “pay for itself,” as those same supporters promised.\n",
      "\n",
      ">What’s more, in the regular polling that occurred for years after the law’s passage, it was almost consistently underwater in favorability.\n",
      "\n",
      ">All in all, probably not such a wise thing for Republicans to launch their economic agenda this way. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      ">And yet: If I had to guess, I’d bet that all or nearly all of the Trump tax cuts will indeed get extended before they lapse — even if Biden is still president when the deadline comes, and even if Democrats somehow achieve unified control over both legislative chambers again.\n",
      "\n",
      ">In designing their 2017 tax overhaul, Republicans did something clever: They made the corporate-side tax changes (mostly) permanent, and the individual-side ones temporary. This made the upfront cost of the bill look a lot cheaper, with the “expectation that no Congress would stand in the way of extending them later on,” says Tax Policy Center’s Steven M. Rosenthal.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Why was it reasonable to assume that future Congresses won’t let the tax cuts sunset, as planned, given how unpopular the original law was? Because the tax cuts did, in fact, benefit most Americans, including the middle class.\n",
      "\n",
      ">While the overall value of bill was heavily weighted toward the wealthy, most households did indeed enjoy at least a little cut to their taxes. Only a tiny sliver of households (about 6 percent) saw their tax liabilities rise as a result of the individual-tax-side changes in the law.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Contrary to popular perception, even in high-tax blue states, no more than 1 in 10 residents saw their taxes rise as a result of the GOP law. (For most people, any increase in their taxes because of the new cap on state and local tax deductions was more than offset by tax reductions elsewhere in the law.)\n",
      "\n",
      ">So, if these individual-side tax provisions lapse, a whole lot of Americans’ tax bills will rise — and whoever stands in the way of extending those provisions will inevitably get blamed for “raising taxes.” President Barack Obama learned this the hard way when he was in the White House and negotiating with Republicans over extensions to the Bush-era tax cuts. After all, once voters have received a benefit, it becomes politically dangerous to ever take that benefit away, even if initially the program seemed unpopular. (Just ask Republicans about Obamacare!)\n",
      "\n",
      ">The White House has so far been noncommittal about its approach to the soon-to-expire Trump tax provisions. But Biden might have already boxed himself into keeping most of them in place.\n",
      "\n",
      ">That’s because he has repeatedly pledged — including in the recent State of the Union — that “nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.” If this “no new taxes” promise is supposed to mean no projected increases due to expiring tax breaks, most of the 2017 law gets extended. Which is still expensive! Depending on exact details, extending all of the expiring provisions other than the top tax rate could cost $2.1 trillion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Even Biden’s proposed billionaire tax wouldn’t raise enough to offset that price tag.\n",
      "\n",

      "The messages are part of a cache of internal correspondence and deposition testimony released Thursday in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the network filed by Dominion, one of the two election software companies at the center of the conspiracy theories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of the cable news network and show how publicly Trump-friendly personalities were privately repulsed by the president’s post-election actions, with Carlson referring to Trump as a “demonic force,” according to the filings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The filing in Delaware State Superior Court ahead of an April trial is meant to bolster Dominion’s argument that Fox leadership was aware that the claims of election fraud were untrue but nonetheless “spread and endorsed” them, the company argued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a single Fox witness testified that they believe any of the allegations about Dominion are true,” Dominion argued in the filing. “Indeed, Fox witness after Fox witness declined to assert the allegations’ truth or actually stated they do not believe them, and Fox witnesses repeatedly testified that they have not seen credible evidence to support them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fox’s news staff was just as loud in raising internal concerns as the star pundits and executives, the filings show. In one message, Fox correspondent Lucas Tomlinson wrote to news anchor Bret Baier referring to “dangerously insane” election claims. Baier, in turn, wrote that “there is NO evidence of fraud” and told Bill Sammon, then the network’s Washington bureau chief, that their team must “prevent this stuff,” meaning the spread of misinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, Fox News downplayed the revelations from the correspondence, saying it was filled with “cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners,” a spokesperson said, “but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a separate counterclaim filing also made public Thursday, Fox alleged that Dominion’s $1.6 billion demand “has no factual support,” arguing that — far from having its value destroyed by Powell and Giuliani’s false claims of fraud — the company is actually “in a solid financial position.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While much of the correspondence aired by Dominion shows Fox officials agonizing over false information on its airwaves, some of the behind-the-scenes torment was about a story the network got right — an election-night projection that Joe Biden would win the hotly contested state of Arizona.\n",

      "Fox’s decision-desk analysts were days ahead of other news outlets in making the controversial call, which infuriated Trump and his supporters — including many Fox viewers.\n",

      "Scott, who forwarded Carlson’s concerns about the Arizona call to Fox Corp CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch, was quoted as saying that Fox’s “brand” was impacted by the “arrogance” of the early — but accurate — call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dominion is using such messages to make the argument that Fox was motivated by competitive pressures from smaller pro-Trump cable stations like Newsmax that threatened to lure away its viewers. Carlson, in his message, specifically warned that Newsmax “could be devastating to us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fox News president Jay Wallace acknowledged in a text message to Scott that it was “a bit troubling” to see Newsmax pick up Fox viewers — an ultimately short-lived gain — adding that the rival network offered “an alternate universe” but that “it can’t be ignored.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Newsmax “should be watched, if skeptically,” Rupert Murdoch told Scott in a Nov. 16, 2020 email, adding that he doesn’t “want to antagonize Trump further.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Scott and Lachlan Murdoch commiserated over how their pro-Trump viewers were “going through the 5 stages of grief,” as Scott put it, promising her corporate boss that Fox would “plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them.” Her boss agreed that a “constant rebuilding without any missteps” was needed after the Arizona call.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can fix this,” Scott wrote, “but we cannot smirk at our viewers any longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dominion’s filings also suggest that Fox brass bristled when its own reporters attempted to push back on election conspiracies on the air. “If this gets picked up, viewers are going to be further disgusted,” Scott wrote in a message after reporter Jacqui Heinrich fact-checked a Trump tweet containing misinformation about Dominion. In a text message, Carlson suggested to Hannity that Heinrich should be fired. Kristen Fisher, then a White House reporter for Fox who has since moved to CNN, testified that her then-boss told her higher-ups were “unhappy” with her own fact-checking segment.\n",

      "In Fox’s own brief requesting the judge rule in its favor, attorneys argue that Fox showed no “actual malice” — the high standard required in defamation cases — because all of the hosts who allowed false claims to be aired honestly believed there was a chance the election might have been stolen using Dominion’s machines.\n",

      "“It is hardly unusual that some people in a newsroom (with the diverse political viewpoints one would expect) will disbelieve the allegations and hope that they ultimately prove false,” Fox’s lawyers wrote, “while others will keep an open mind in hopes that they prove true.”\n",

      "People here love to say \"derp, but that was only low-level henchmen, what was he doing all that time\" but people who say that are *fucking morons*.  The rapid roundup of hundreds of rioters and insurrectionists was probably the most incredible and effective coordination/harnessing of nationwide federal prosecution power in history.  There will be history books and law courses dedicated to studying what the DOJ accomplished in that first year alone.   And that was when Garland was \"the new guy!\"  Talk about hitting the ground running.  \n",

      "People also overlook an incredibly important detail.  If there's *any chance* of holding Trump accountable for the violence at the Capitol, you need evidence and testimony from the people *who were involved in the violence at the Capitol.*  In the process of convicting all those Capitol-stormers, Garland got hundreds of people to testify on the record that Trump incited them to do it.   He secured many Obstruction of an Official Proceeding convictions from people who confessed they tried to stop the election certification on Trump's behalf.  He secured convictions of people who committed violence against Capitol police officers while waving Trump flags.  He proved, through convictions, that some of the militants at the Capitol were Conspired Seditiously to obstruct Congress and keep Trump in power.  So all those \"low level henchmen\" convictions and testimony are the start of a firm legal foundation demonstrating that at least a portion of the riot was indeed an insurrection, and that it was indisputably caused by Trump's words and actions.  \n",

      "Unfortunately I think convicting Trump of Incitement of Insurrection is still a long shot.  Incitement is notoriously hard to prove in court (even when it's *plainly obvious* to the naked eye), and proving Insurrection is basically unprecedented.  But if the DOJ does take this shot, the case will be built upon the foundation they established with all these \"low level\" convictions.  *There is no path to convicting Trump for Capitol violence without them*, so people who scoff at these \"low level\" convictions are really short-sighted.  \n",

There is absolutely no reason or justification to claim that \"none of the people responsible for this mess will be prosecuted.\"  Quite the contrary: they are still investigating, filing subpoenas for evidence, testimony, financial records, etc.  The DOJ investigates for one reason alone: to find evidence of crimes.

Not only that the electorate especially on the Republic side is extremely entrenched with a base that has a stranglehold especially during their primaries and the electorate is more vindictive now just look at those who voted to impeach Trump as they are out of a job now. Pretty sure that’s not what happened after Nixon resigned. Gerrymandering pretty much eliminates competing against the opposition, but you need to worry more about someone in your own party. Go against the base and you’ll suffer for it. Most Republicans could give a crap about crazy, they only care about results. Most crazies often fully go along with what the base wants.\n",

      "What happens when Florida and Texas blacklist Wall Street’s largest municipal bond underwriters because of their support for environmental, social and governance practices? The answer is a hidden tax foisted on their residents amounting to hundreds of millions of additional dollars.\n",

      "If socialism means state control of production, distribution and exchange of goods and services, then Florida and Texas fit the description. That’s not the case with California, whose embrace of ESG and free markets has allowed it to borrow more cheaply than Florida and Texas even though it has lower credit ratings. Superior demand makes California debt the outstanding performer among the three largest US states.\n",

      "Companies committed to ESG favor protection of natural resources, human rights, health and safety, community engagement, transparency, compliance with regulatory policies, diversity, equity and inclusion. Investors like the potential. Asset allocation based on ESG criteria has grown to be at least a $35 trillion industry, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. The iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF has expanded 3,400 times to $20 billion since its inception in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. No less than Larry Fink, chairman, chief executive officer and co-founder of BlackRock Inc., whose $10 trillion in assets makes it the largest money manager, is a believer. He told his shareholders that Wall Street’s embrace of ESG is “capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers and communities your company relies on to prosper.”  Elected officials in Florida and Texas, not to mention half a dozen other states which voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, don’t want their residents to believe that. They decry ESG as “woke,” ignoring its original meaning (as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Stephen Carter explained) as a watchword for Black Americans derived from a Mississippi Delta blues song warning euphemistically of labor exploitation in the early 20th century mills. These southern states, where  racist laws prevailed 50 years ago, now prohibit the biggest Wall Street banks from arranging and selling their new bond offerings because they’re “woke,” often assigning the job smaller firms that may not have the resources or reach to ensure that the borrowers are getting the lowest possible borrowing costs. In Texas alone, the state’s municipal borrowers are paying as much as $532 million more in borrowing costs because of Republican lawmakers’ war with Wall Street over ESG, according to a paper published last year by Daniel Garrett, a University of Pennsylvania professor, and Ivan Ivanov, a principal economist at the Federal Reserve.  Citigroup Inc. initially was excluded from handling a bond sale by the Lone Star state after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, himself indicted five years ago on still unsettled felony securities law charges, determined the bank “discriminates” against the firearms industry. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., with 25,500 Texas employees (the most in any state outside New York), were similarly barred over their support for gun safety regulations and alternative energy. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan managed $540 billion of municipal offerings during the past five years, or 25% of the market for new issues, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average 0.38% fee the banks charged were 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, lower than the average for 145 underwriters.  Since it began its assault on ESG in 2022, Texas, with its perfect AAA credit rating, is paying 19 basis points more in yield (the equivalent of $1.9 million on every $1 billion of bonds sold) than AA rated California on routine borrowings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sudden cheapening of Texas debt is a marked contrast to the zero average spread between Texas and California new debt issues since 2005, when such data initially was compiled. The city of Anna, Texas, in September paid more than it should have on two bond sales totaling almost $100 million when it rejected the most competitive bid from Citigroup because of the Republican-backed state law punishing financial firms for promoting gun safety.  With JPMorgan, a major employer in the state through its acquisitions of Texas Commerce and First National Bank of Houston in the last century, Texas now is biting the hand that feeds it. JPMorgan contributed more than $17.5 million to non-profit workforce readiness programs, community development and neighborhood revitalization in 2019 and continues to expand its main Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio workforce among the hundreds of branches in 130 Texas locations throughout the state.Florida became a visible antagonist of ESG last year when Governor Ron DeSantis revoked Walt Disney Co.’s special tax and self-governing privileges after the state’s largest private employer criticized the DeSantis law prohibiting classroom instruction about sexual orientation. DeSantis then redrew a congressional map diminishing Black representation, fired the elected state prosecutor of Tampa for refusing to enforce the state’s 15-week abortion ban, announced new election police that later charged 20 people for mistakenly voting in 2020 in a deceptive crackdown on insignificant voter fraud, and rounding up Venezuelan asylum seekers in San Antonio and sending them on private planes to Massachusetts at the expense of Florida taxpayers.Most recently, DeSantis barred high school students from taking an Advanced Placement course in African American history on the 100-year anniversary of the Rosewood Massacre, the racially motivated murder and destruction of a Florida community. He is simultaneously defunding diversity programs at state colleges and universities while ousting the president of New College of Florida and closing the diversity offices at the public liberal arts institution in Sarasota.  DeSantis now attacks the giants of money management and securities underwriting for opposing fossil fuel, voter suppression and the criminalizing of reproductive rights as they promote investment strategies furthering sustainability, the essential pillar of ESG. For all his venom toward ESG, DeSantis is poisoning the market for AAA rated Florida debt. Shorn of the liquidity that comes from a robust group of underwriters, Florida now pays 43 basis points more in yield (or $4.3 million for every $1 billion of bonds sold) than California with an inferior credit rating, or 0.35% more than it did prior to 2022. The Florida deterioration is a record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This is what happens when socialism comes to the Lone Star and Sunshine States.--With assistance from Shin Pei and Matthew Himel.
