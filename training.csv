Railroad workers have been fighting through the contract negotiation process for relief from the conditions, which are very stressful and very demanding and have been exacerbated by precision scheduled railroading and the corporate greed. We’ve been trying to get relief from that. That would certainly help us in responding to and better managing our jobs to ensure that this doesn’t happen. But this isn’t going to be solved by one labor contract. It is systemic, and it needs some regulation. It needs regulators to step in and correct this, or we’re going to continue to see things like what happened in Ohio a couple weeks ago.

""It is systemic, and it need some regulation.""  Seems to be the phrase of these past few decades.  Income inequality, police brutality, health insurance, and overall profit over people.

Yet the one entity that can fight and is big enough, the US government is being ripped apart.  We have a Just Us system for the wealthy, just us rich, and just us powerful, the rest don't get it.

Right now, what I'm getting from you is that you're fine with trans people committing suicide due to distress from gender dysphoria because it's not the dysphoria directly killing them? If it prevents the person from losing their life, it is literally life saving. And that makes it medically necessary (unless you are fine with them dying).

As for whether the bill will pass or not, we do not know at all. People used to think that Roe vs Wade would not be overturned but look at what things are at now. As for drag queens, there is a difference between the types you go to and the types that are for children. Perhaps you could try going to the children friendly ones like Drag Queen story times to see what those are like (the ones Republicans are trying to ban). Also, the bills tend to label drag as ""someone performing while using dress, makeup and mannerisms associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth"" which is vague enough to encompass trans people. Which means that as long as a trans person is considered ""performing"" in a place where a minor can see them, they could be considered to have broken the law and be sent to prison. 

Also, all of these is just sidetracking from the fact that you deem trans people who are in prison to be worthy of suffering from dysphoria and that if they die, you're fine with it. Including the fact that you don't care why they might be in prison (even if it's due to being homeless), it's hard to not see you as a heartless person. And I honestly don't think what you are doing currently is fighting for LGBTQ rights when you seem ok with sacrificing trans people who are in prison.

PS. Republicans have repeatedly stated their desire to execute doctors who provide gender affirming care, have tried to ban LGBTQ books, have stated that they want to send trans people to a camp, and tried to make supporting your child if they're trans child abuse. Certain Republican leaders are also attempting to gather lists of trans people. Is that still not enough to label them as fascists?

“Federal law requires criminal background checks for firearm sales only at licensed dealers. Private sales between individuals, including at gun shows or online, aren’t subject to background checks.”

How often are you reporting cash given by a friend as a gift or borrowed to go buy something? How often do you think people are honestly reporting the actual amount they paid when privately purchasing a car? How would you even begin to track private transactions even if there was a universal registration of all firearms?!? You would only be able to punish someone after they committed the crime still. 


There are already background checks on a federal level. For this to even be possible to enforce you would need to somehow force a strict registration of all firearms (which is realistically not going to happen or be enforceable itself) AND this would then still only prevent murders from people who care about the legality of owning a firearm, but not about murdering people (seems like an incredibly small percentage).

My wheelhouse is software development for critical aircraft systems, which are supposed to be regulated by the FAA. And this crash reminds me of Boeing’s 737 Max crashes. It takes multiple often cascading (and mostly preventable) failures all along the system to end up with catastrophic events like this. And all of these failures have one thing in common: CEOs and their top management teams squeezing every last dime out of their business, to pay themselves and their shareholders obscene profits.  And the other half believes wholeheartedly in the goals, objectives, and methods of end-stage neoliberalism?

Of course the results are entirely predictable. But what can we do when roughly half the US voters believe all regulation is bad, God gave us capitalism because we are exceptional, and CEOs are smart and praiseworthy businessmen who earned their obscene wealth? While the other half hates socialism, believes unwaveringly in the aims and methods of neoliberalism, and can’t even be convinced that health care is a human right?",0

They did. The problem is collusion isn't a crime.

They held campaign strategy meetings with Russian intelligence, that's not illegal.

Likewise giving Russian intelligence polling data is not a crime, nothing to charge there.

The Russian ambassador met with campaign officials including at Trump tower, not a crime.

Papadop knew of the jacked emails in advanced, not a crime

Stone had what was almost certainly the DNC emails and was handing them out to people, surprisingly not a crime.

Credico knew of the wikileaks dump ahead of time, not a crime.

They sent a mercenary to meet Russian spies on a volcanic island off the coast of Madagascar, not a crime.

>Thousands of employees of the Environmental Protection Agency are lobbying this week for Congress to address staffing issues that they say are limiting their ability to meaningfully carry out the Biden administration’s ambitious climate goals. 

>Leaders of AFGE Council 238, a union representing roughly half of the EPA’s 14,000-member workforce, said in a memo that non competitive salaries and a lack of career development opportunities are fueling attrition and overburdening staff. Congress could address these issues by expanding the EPA’s funding in the annual appropriations legislation, which it will write later this year. Failure to do so, the union warned, will jeopardize the implementation of President Joe Biden’s two major legislative achievements — the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

....

>Today, the workforce is around the size that it was under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The AFGE has said that the agency will need 20,000 full-time staff, a 40 percent increase, to carry out the programs it has been tasked with. 

>Nicole Cantello, who practiced as an EPA attorney for three decades before joining AFGE Council 238 full time in 2020, told Grist that the issue is not only with hiring, but also with retention. A dearth of promotional opportunities and limited work-from-home options have caused retirement-age employees to depart early. Roughly 20 percent of the EPA’s staff have been at the agency for 30 years or more and could elect to retire soon.

My industry opponents have hidden behind dark money groups and surrogates because they fear a pragmatic, pro-competition, pro-consumer policymaker who will support policies that will bring more, faster, and lower-priced broadband.”

She’s correct. The GOP is effectively a hand puppet for telecom and media giants terrified of the FCC having a functional voting majority. They’re desperate to keep all the mindless handouts they received during the Trump administration, whether that’s the gutting of the FCC’s consumer protection authority, the repeal of net neutrality rules, or the removal of media consolidation limits.

Democrats carry their own share of the blame. President Biden’s nomination of Sohn was inexplicably delayed nine months. Chuck Schumer has consistently failed to whip the votes necessary to get Sohn over the finish line. Maria Cantwell has continually pandered to GOP demands for unnecessary, additional show trials. Senators Mark Kelly, Joe Manchin, and Catherine Cortez Masto have dragged their feet on providing necessary votes, even at times parroting baseless industry claims without fact checking.

The great irony here is that even if Sohn gets confirmed and seated I’m highly doubtful that the Rosenworcel FCC has the political backbone to do even a quarter of the things industry is worried about. This idea that the FCC, an agency that has been under industry’s thumb for more than a generation (with only brief, fleeting exceptions), will be dramatically reformed via the addition of one actual reformer is grade school thinking and scare mongering.”

Cubone here had all 4, but apparently the vaccination company was switched midway through causing him to be partially immune. 

It’s a very depressing disease with a high mortality rate in younger pups, but he’s a strong boy. He fought like hell and I am thankful he’s still here running around and jumping all over our apartment again.

If you have a dog and he has all his shots don’t rule out a parvo test if the signs show (especially if they are young!):

Lethargic

Vomit

Diarrhea

Sore abdomen

Drooling

High fever

Bloody stool/vomit

Not eating/Drinking

It’s better to be safe and bring him/her in. I almost waited overnight, but something made me try to find a vet because he was just vomiting and lethargic. Since we got it figured out early, we got to keep him up health wise instead of bringing him back up and out of a critical position. 

That night I would have waited through, he had a 106 degree fever which is deadly on it’s own. I spent the entire night cooling him off, but if I didn’t go, I wouldn’t have known and he could have died that night on me.

And I feel for anyone who thinks the same. If you waited too long for it to be too late, you didn’t know.

**Stellers Sea cow, the largest known sea cow, was discovered by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741 and was extinct by 1768 - only 27 years after their discovery.**

Stellers Sea Cow grew longer than 9 meters (30 feet) and is estimated to have weighted up to 10 tons (11 short tons) and was the by far largest known member of the Sirenians (commonly known as Sea Cows, including the Dugong and Manatee)

One reason behind their fast extinction is suspected to be that they were unique among marine animals in that they were **completely buoyant** \- as in they literally couldn't dive. Instead they simply floated around the cold arctic shallows, grazing peacefully like chubby rafts of fat. This meant that they were extremely easy to spot and couldn't escape into the depths either like literally every other fully aquatic animal.

>*Steller described the sea cow as being* ***highly social***\*. It lived in small family groups and\* ***helped injured members***\*, and was also apparently monogamous. Steller's sea cow may have\* ***exhibited parental care***\*, and the young were kept at the front of the herd for protection against predators. Steller reported that\* ***as a female was being captured, a group of other sea cows attacked the hunting boat*** *by ramming and rocking it,* ***and after the hunt, her mate followed the boat to shore, even after the captured animal had died.***

1278,"The article from the Washington Post:

> Here’s a dirty little secret about those expensive, unpopular Trump tax cuts: We’re probably stuck with them for good, because neither party seems to have the political courage to let them lapse. Not the Republicans who supposedly care about fiscal responsibility, and not the Democrats who are on record as hating them.

>This past week, more than 70 Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to make permanent the 2017 GOP-passed tax cuts, large chunks of which are scheduled to expire in 2025. The new bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Vern Buchanan (Fla.), credited the original tax cuts for “historic economic growth” and promised more “prosperity” ahead if they’re extended.

>The White House, among others, has repeatedly attacked the proposed Trump tax-cut extension. With pretty good reason: At precisely the same time that Republicans are raising a hue-and-cry about federal deficits, they’re proposing a measure that would massively worsen our fiscal challenges.

>Extending President Donald Trump’s individual tax cuts in full would add around $3 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, according to various estimates. As President Biden and others have pointed out, this is of a piece with other GOP-endorsed proposals that would widen deficits, such as repealing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and undoing Democrats’ prescription-drug pricing overhaul.

>Moreover, extending the Trump tax cuts sounds pretty plutocratic: By far, the biggest benefits would go to higher-income households, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.

>There is also little evidence that the 2017 tax law significantly boosted growth, at least based on the investment-driven theories touted by its supporters. It definitely didn’t generate enough economic growth to “pay for itself,” as those same supporters promised.

>What’s more, in the regular polling that occurred for years after the law’s passage, it was almost consistently underwater in favorability.

>All in all, probably not such a wise thing for Republicans to launch their economic agenda this way. Right?

>And yet: If I had to guess, I’d bet that all or nearly all of the Trump tax cuts will indeed get extended before they lapse — even if Biden is still president when the deadline comes, and even if Democrats somehow achieve unified control over both legislative chambers again.

>In designing their 2017 tax overhaul, Republicans did something clever: They made the corporate-side tax changes (mostly) permanent, and the individual-side ones temporary. This made the upfront cost of the bill look a lot cheaper, with the “expectation that no Congress would stand in the way of extending them later on,” says Tax Policy Center’s Steven M. Rosenthal.

>Why was it reasonable to assume that future Congresses won’t let the tax cuts sunset, as planned, given how unpopular the original law was? Because the tax cuts did, in fact, benefit most Americans, including the middle class.

>While the overall value of bill was heavily weighted toward the wealthy, most households did indeed enjoy at least a little cut to their taxes. Only a tiny sliver of households (about 6 percent) saw their tax liabilities rise as a result of the individual-tax-side changes in the law.

>Contrary to popular perception, even in high-tax blue states, no more than 1 in 10 residents saw their taxes rise as a result of the GOP law. (For most people, any increase in their taxes because of the new cap on state and local tax deductions was more than offset by tax reductions elsewhere in the law.)

>So, if these individual-side tax provisions lapse, a whole lot of Americans’ tax bills will rise — and whoever stands in the way of extending those provisions will inevitably get blamed for “raising taxes.” President Barack Obama learned this the hard way when he was in the White House and negotiating with Republicans over extensions to the Bush-era tax cuts. After all, once voters have received a benefit, it becomes politically dangerous to ever take that benefit away, even if initially the program seemed unpopular. (Just ask Republicans about Obamacare!)

>The White House has so far been noncommittal about its approach to the soon-to-expire Trump tax provisions. But Biden might have already boxed himself into keeping most of them in place.

>That’s because he has repeatedly pledged — including in the recent State of the Union — that “nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.” If this “no new taxes” promise is supposed to mean no projected increases due to expiring tax breaks, most of the 2017 law gets extended. Which is still expensive! Depending on exact details, extending all of the expiring provisions other than the top tax rate could cost $2.1 trillion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

>Even Biden’s proposed billionaire tax wouldn’t raise enough to offset that price tag.

>Once upon a time, when both parties pretended to care about fiscal responsibility, Republicans generally favored addressing budget challenges through spending cuts, and Democrats through tax increases. Today, everyone’s on record as opposing just about anything that might make a significant dent in the deficit.",0

&#x200B;

Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive:

He stood six foot six and weighed 245.

Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip,

And everybody knew you didn’t give no lip

To Big John.

Big John, Big John, Big Bad John

Big John

Nobody seemed to know where John called home;

He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.

He didn’t say much, was kinda quiet and shy,

And if you spoke at all, you just said “Hi”

To Big John.

Somebody said he came from New Orleans

Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen,

And a crashing blow from a huge right hand

Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land:

Big John.

Big John, Big John, Big Bad John

Big John

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine

When a timber cracked and men started cryin’,

Miners were praying, and hearts beat fast,

And everybody thought that they had breathed their last,

Except John.

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell

Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well,

Grabbed a sagging timber and gave out with a groan,

And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone:

Big John.

Big John, Big John, Big Bad John

Big John

Then with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove,

Then a miner yelled out, “There’s a light up above!”

And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave,

And now there’s only one left down there to save:

Big John.

With jacks and timbers they started back down,

Then came that rumble ’way down in the ground,

And when smoke and gas belched out of that mine,

Everybody knew it was the end of the line

For Big John.

Big John, Big John, Big Bad John

Big John

Now they never reopened that worthless pit,

They just placed a marble stand in front of it.

These few words are written on that stand:

“At the bottom of this mine lies one hell of a man:

Big John.”

Big John, Big John, Big Bad John

Big John, Big John, Big Bad John

Big John",0

Our approach to policing differs in several areas including organization and training.

Basic US law enforcement training takes 21 weeks on average, and I believe it is 16 weeks in Oregon.  As a comparison, to become an Esthetician, there is a minimum of 600 hours of training that takes approximately 5 to 8 months to complete.   

Law enforcement training programs in European countries can last more than three years.  Some may argue that requiring more training will make the shortage of law enforcement worse. That is, of course, probably true in the immediate future but at what point do we pivot and acknowledge that a more educated police force would be better to address the very challenging dangerous jobs they have.  Do we really want to expect law enforcement, armed police, to respond to every hypothetical situation involving mental health crises?  

In 2019, CAHOOTS in Eugene and Springfield, used unarmed medics and crisis workers to respond to 911 calls relating to individuals experiencing psychological crises, responding to 24,000 calls, about 20% of total 911 dispatches.

>This was before Powell appeared on the November 8, 2020, edition of Bartiromo's Fox Business show, ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

>But they included excerpts in which the source claimed Dominion was to blame for election irregularities, and *also described herself as ""internally decapitated.""*

>One particularly odd section deals with how the source claims to have gotten her information. It says:

>""Who am I? And how do I know all of this?...I've had the strangest dreams since I was a little girl....I was *internally decapitated*, and yet, I live....*The Wind tells me I'm a ghost*, but I don't believe it.""

The attorney tried to grill me on it, but I knew all the answers, and even called him out for using incorrect terminology (which made the judge and jury chuckle).

Dude got five years, because A) he illegally took a federally protected species B) on a federal wildlife refuge C) with an illegal weapon (can't hunt with crossbows), and D) it was his second offense.  In addition he lost his truck, his crossbow, and his wife, who divorced him over it.

My favourite cake is ""toothpaste cake."" My boyfriend and I love chocolate mint, but that's seen as a weird combination in the Netherlands, so we have to make our own chocolate mint. He made me a chocolate cake for my birthday one year, and wanted to make mint icing.

That year was that pesky Corona year, when one wasn't advised to just pop down to the shop to grab an ingredient you forgot, or misjudged the quantity of a key ingredient. I can't cook, so I have no idea what he was missing, but there was nowhere near enough icing to cover the cake, and it was the wrong consistency and it looked like he had tried to cover the cake with a very sad blob of toothpaste. Not only that, the blob was very sticky and didn't want to spread, so it kept kind in receding back to its central location. In the end it looked like he had just spat used toothpaste in the cake. It was incredibly unattractive, but it tasted so good.

And now every year I tell him I want toothpaste cake. He's found variations on the toothpaste part, but it's always amazing.

>  
>When Insider followed up regarding the impact eliminating the department would have on Pell Grants, student loans, and other financial aid operations, Massie's office did not respond.

Because of course he wouldn’t. Among other things, Massie is one fo those GOP vulgar libertarians who doesn’t think through or care about the consequences of just cutting everything out, I mean obviously this won’t pass for a lot of reasons, he’s doing it for attention.

Edit, also it’s not how it works to “save money.”

>Congress recently approved a $1.7 trillion budget for the government, including $79.6 billion for the Education Department. Of that funding, $45 billion is going to K-12 programs, with the majority allocated to grants for low-income neighborhoods and special-education programs, and about $30 billion is going to higher education and federal student aid funding, including loans and Pell Grants.

""We need to redefine what it means to be a Republican,"" he said in an interview.

> In pursuit of that aim, Smith and other hardliners deployed armed guards to bar moderate delegates from a county meeting last August, threatening to bring criminal trespassing charges against them, according to an email to the moderates seen by Reuters.

> Smith, who is running for party chair in his congressional district, also helped persuade state party officials to exclude moderates from his county from a vote on Saturday to choose the leaders who will steer Michigan Republicans into the 2024 elections.

> Far-right Republican groups are making inroads across the state, according to Reuters' interviews with two dozen party leaders, grassroots members and political experts, sidelining moderate voices, risking relationships with major donors and complicating the state party's efforts to rebuild after their worst election results since 1984.

> America First Republicans now control local party leadership in more than half of Michigan's 83 counties, a senior party official estimated, paving the way for an important victory on Saturday when an election denier is expected to be elected to state party chair.

> ""What's going on in Michigan is a microcosm of what is going on with the Republican Party nationally,"" said Michael Traugott, a professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.

> In Smith's Hillsdale County, allegiance to Trump's false claims that the 2020 election were stolen runs deep. Trump won more than 70% of the vote in 2020. In January 2021 local congressman Tim Walberg voted against certifying Joe Biden's victory.

> Last July, the far-right faction adopted a resolution to ""protect the party from a hostile takeover of actors with intent to dilute or destroy the values of the party,"" voting to expel 70 moderates. The resolution, which Reuters has seen, claimed the party had been ""infiltrated"" in the 1970s by members who practice socialism.

The US is still quite reluctant to have an honest conversation about its history because a lot of people grew up with this narrative that painted a picture of the US as being a beacon of freedom, but what's not often discussed is how that freedom wasn't extended to most people at the founding of the country -- and that many groups fought for years to gain rights -- often to the opposition of white Americans.

Do you actually want the historical answer, instead of conspiracy theories about how ""Israelis control the US""? 

Fighting between Israel and Arab states, namely Egypt, throughout the 1950s to 1970s continually threatened the safety of commerce through the Suez Canal. The front line between Egyptian and Israeli forces was literally the canal itself from 1967-1979. In order to remove this threat to global trade, the United States began to provide massive amounts of aid to Israel AND Egypt (Jordan was roped in later), in what essentially amounts to a bribe to all involved countries to not fight each other. There is nothing strange or out of place about this in the geopolitical and historical context. If we cut aid to Israel, we also have to cut aid to Egypt *and* Jordan, or else the scales of power in the region would be unbalanced on a fundamental level, and war could erupt again. Love it or hate it, but this is how international relations is done. Either advocate for all three nations to receive no US aid, and then watch the region devolve into warfare again... or just, don't do that. 

Going beyond this, my personal take: Both Egypt and Jordan receive billions in aid from us each year as well, for the exact same underlying reason that Israel does, but no one focuses on that because no Jews, no news.",0

unfortunately a lot of votin' folk don't think about other people's motives, nor does it run across their purt lil minds that someone might *rent* prisoners out for labor.

while renting people usually don't sit well with most folk, them as have a shoe-size iq might think it's only right the ”prisoners” pay their own way.

*this* sounds all nice a purdy on the wireless when some slick politician says it, but it you think about it *at all*, puttin' people in a place they don't wanna be and keepin' 'em in a place they don't wanna stay and makin' them work a job they don't wanna work has another name fer it that y'all should be mighty familiar with.


then these involuntary people-renters take it up a few notches: they'll make the pris'ners do dangerous things like fight forest fires without proper training or protection, they'll charge the pris'ners for food and lodging and *teethpaste* and $5-10 to make a phone calls and another quarter a minute.

and now they're making prisons into companies and charging the government to house prisoners and makin' contracts guaranteein' how many pris'ners will be in the lockup, and they are making the prison screws worse because now they're *company* prison screws and the company is expectin' to make a profit, where a government don't.

so every dime an' dollar the prison company saves is another dime an' dollar that some rich guys who own it but don't bother visitin' get to put in their pockets. an' us taxpayers don't get no discount: we get lawyered and sued because the prison company is so bad, and our taxes pay their lawyers and the lawsuits.

an' you all voted for that, even if you didn't vote. 

it needs fixin'.

lot's 'o things need to fixin' now'a'days, 'specially because we sold something the government aught to do and we sold it to a private company.

prisons. highways. government buildings then we lease 'em back and it's just some rich folks takin' our taxes again. 

hell, those rich bastards are coming after our schools now, even though they sent their kids away to private school.

2999,"My Theory: The GOP shot their wad with Fox News and now they are paying the price. For the few folks on Reddit that don't know; Fox News was the brainchild of Roger Ailes who was in the Nixon White House during Watergate and felt Nixon could have survived if there was a right wing 'news' outlet that could get their narrative out, and (quote) 'do the viewer's thinking for them'..

It couldn't happen overnight, but Republicans play a great long game. Reagan eliminated the Fairness Doctrine, the craft was honed on talk radio, rag TV shows, etc.... but finally in 1996 he found his biggest benefactor in Rupert Murdoch. They spent the next 27 years spewing hate, disinformation, stupidity, and propaganda. And it worked! It helped get George W. Bush elected; it was a key mouthpiece for the Iraq war, it helped get Bush re-elected, it helped kneecap the Obama administration in 2010, it helped get Trump elected in 2016... life was good.

I want to pause for a second and explain how insanely toxic Fox News is to its viewers. This isn't ""right leaning"" the way MSNBC leans left. Almost every single detail is propagandized. The graphics, the color scheme, the music... all specifically chosen... when a white Christian conservative is on; the color scheme will literally change to calming whites and blues, with the US flag likely making an appearance. The sound is lower, the speech is slower and softer. When a leftist, Democrat, immigrant, minority, BLM etc. clip is playing the color scheme is red, black, the sound changes. Lastly, and most importantly, some portion of every single day is spent painting Democrats as dangerous lunatics bent on destroying the country. Random Tuesday in 1997 with absolutely nothing to report on? Let's find a 'wacko' college professor who is poisoning America's youth with communism. It has been 9628 days of nonstop rage. If you truly believed what you were watching...why WOULDN'T you hate Democrats and try to stop them no matter what it takes.

But a funny thing happened on the way... 

A new generation of GOP voters and, more importantly, an increasing number of elected officials, arrived that were raised on Fox News (and eventually right-wing internet). The viewers went from 'useful idiots' rowing the boat to the captains behind the wheel. The 'traditional Conservatives' that never quite believed this nonsense but were happy to accept the votes (the 'adults' in the room) aged out. The old guard of Dole, Kemp, Ford, Bush Sr., George Will, Cheney, McCain had lost control of the monster, replaced by MTG, Boebert, Gaetz, Rick Scott, Trump.

Now here's the problem. As passionate as the true believers are... they are no longer the majority. Not to say they can't do immense damage to the country. But 2022 midterm turnout was 111 million people, Fox News lead viewship on election night at 7 million. And remember Fox News is now the 'sane' right-wing option. Obviously millions more conservatives get their news and facts elsewhere... but those facts are even more deranged. 

All of this leads to a problem that used to plague the Democrats... the core GOP message has fallen out of orbit with the rest of the country and is drifting into outer space. Again, they are still plenty dangerous. But the old ""go right in the primary, tack to the center in the general"" model has been incinerated. A generation raised on almost 30 years of propaganda demand candidates as crazy and furious as they are. And the center (myself included, former GOP) think it's fucking bonkers.

At the same time, behind those Boomers and Gen Xers are a new generation of voter that not only wanted nothing to do with Fox News; but were instead raised with the internet. 'Socialism' does not invoke images of Soviet bread lines in their mind; it invokes images of the 'Nordic model' of paved roads, free education, and universal healthcare (those countries aren't actually socialist, but still...). These youth also grew up with mass shooter drills in school. They saw their Fox News-watching parents get destroyed economically in 2008. Then they watched some of their parents and grandparents die from Covid because Fox News and Twitter told them the vaccine had microchips in it.
And most importantly, they vote. More so than any 'youth' voting bloc before them. Young voters are pissed and engaged.  .

And Fox News helped to kill off nearly 600,000 (and counting) GOP voters to a now preventable death.

As mentioned the GOP is still very capable of harming the country. And any young Latino (in Florida in particular) will tell you that the right's new target for propaganda and misinformation is older Latinos. But if the GOP were a stock I would short it. They decided to hit up the ATM and go all-in, and for a while it was on a roll. But they're crapping out.",-1

He pulls his right hand out from behind his back and I come to find he chopped of the tip of his right thumb doing yard work by himself at one of the properties he owns.

3496,"that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is actually NOT the most huggable pokemon? This is a common misconception, with the real most huggable pokemon being Sylveon, of course! A Sylveon is not only a great companion to cuddle and spend time with, but is also an expert at emotional support. They can use their ribbon-like feelers to read your emotions and therefore can know whenever you're sad, angry, lonely, etc, resulting in it always knowing exactly what's wrong without even needing to ask, helping it cheer you up accordingly. Since it evolved from its love for you, a Sylveon would probably be more affectionate than any other Eeveelution would be, allowing for prolonged sessions of cuddling or hugging to help cheer you up. Due to evolving from love, you can safely assume that it would have incredibly soft fur for cuddling or hugging. A Sylveon also has an impressive Special Defense stat of 130, meaning they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. As a result of this, whenever you feel stressed out for any reason, or simply want someone to talk to, you can vent to it while hugging or cuddling, and it won't mind. Not only this, but Sylveon can also learn Calm Mind by TR, which can not only raise its special defense, but also get rid of any stress caused by venting to it. They can also learn and use moves such as Charm and Baby-Doll Eyes to make itself even more endearing. Let's not forget that Sylveon can also release a soothing aura from its feelers to calm you down, helping you deal with any anger or frustration you could ever face. Not only did Sylveon evolve because it loves you, it evolved because you love it, so it's safe to say even seeing your beloved Sylveon would cause a dopamine rush. As an added bonus, if you like going on walks, your Sylveon will wrap its feelers around your arm and walk with you. Sylveon are also known to battle against dragon pokemon many times larger than itself, so not only will your Sylveon provide amazing emotional support, your Sylveon will also defend you from any threat, should the time ever come that it would be required to.",1

3587,"> The toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, is drawing new attention to the dangers of increasingly long freight trains — part of a series of cost-savings efforts by freight railroads that have drawn scrutiny from the industry’s critics.

> The GAO authors note multiple concerns about train length, including that it can hamper crews’ ability to operate the trains, it can take longer for brakes to stop them, and safety risks can arise when firetrucks can’t get past multiple blocked rail crossings.

> At the same time, one industry analyst noted, freight railroads such as Norfolk Southern, which operated the trains in the Ohio disaster, cannot refuse to carry hazardous materials such as vinyl chloride, one of the toxic, flammable chemicals released in East Palestine. That’s because railroads are considered “common carriers,” which are obligated to transport any legally permitted product.

> The DOT under Obama had issued a rule in 2015 requiring railroads to use electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on certain especially dangerous trains, in response to a spate of fiery derailments of freight cars transporting crude oil. But the Trump administration repealed the braking mandate in 2017, after a National Academy of Sciences study failed to conclusively determine that ECP braking technology was superior to others.

> The Ohio derailment has also brought intensifying criticism of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, including from conservative media outlets that slammed him for not speaking publicly about the accident until 10 days after it happened. Progressives like Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) are also laying the incident in Buttigieg’s lap and calling on him to take “direct action.”

> Unions in particular target railroads’ implementation during the past decade of “precision scheduled railroading,” an operating model that focuses on minimizing workforce costs and maximizing equipment efficiency, including not leaving train cars idle.

Extending President Donald Trump’s individual tax cuts in full would add around $3 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, according to various estimates. As President Biden and others have pointed out, this is of a piece with other GOP-endorsed proposals that would widen deficits, such as repealing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and undoing Democrats’ prescription-drug pricing overhaul.

The investors don't care what is our isn't woke, but they know they get more money being woke than not. It's the same reason every company is rainbow for precisely one month a year, of they signal support for the LGBT any longer they might lose enough money from the fraction of anti-woke types that are allergic to rainbows... I think the reason is the woke types have been told no with a stated reason of profit for long enough that more caught on to the concept of driving change through small decisions like what type of cookies you buy, from an individual standpoint it's negligible, but when a hundred million people do this it creates statistically significant difference in what is and isn't profitable. 

It's part of why Democrats talk about fostering competition a lot, as competition can lower profit margins and make this type of thing the difference between profitable and unprofitable in some circumstances. Go woke go broke has been proven false multiple times, but go fash no cash hasn't. Unless you think Nike, M&Ms, and Disney are on the ropes... Woke things like green energy also tend to have up front costs, but are a net positive over the long term, at a certain point going woke as a corporation is just a simple calculation.

4086,"Even if you somehow think the pentagon does need all that money, let's be clear on something - the pentagon itself doesn't want those ships, planes, or prices. These are legacy systems that suck up money, time, people, space, and materials. It's an albatross around our necks at a time when we want to clean house and invest in better quality and refresh for the future. This sort of stuff requires us to have more troops, more money, and more waste. 

The military has been trying to cut outdated equipment for decades. They have constantly asked for the following assets to be scrapped, only for congress to refuse:

* The A-10 Warthog, a CAS plane designed around an oversized bomb. The A-10 serves in modern times as a light bomber with limited battlefield utility. It's expensive, ineffective, and famously involved in friendly fire incidents. The Military constantly demands to divest it, but congress refuses because it's a meme. 

* All the Freedom class Littoral Combat Ships. The LCS is a lemon. It's transmission doesn't work, it's engines can't be used, it can't shoot it's guns, and it's completely useless in general. Congress refuses because it's a new ship and it's a massive pork barrel for their districts. 

* A few dozen of our older F-22s. They're expensive, they're a bit worn down, and they can't be used in combat. Congress is reluctant to let them divest any, even though we now have more fifth generation stealth fighters than the rest of the world combined, the largest air force overall by several orders of magnitude, and generally don't need that many. Congress refuses because they're scared of looking weak and it provides jobs. 

* dozens of older F-15s, 16s, and 18s. Old fighters that are past their service life and need lots of upgrades. We can afford to put them in storage and spend more on the planes we have. Planes need to be flown, they need pilots flying them, techs fixing them, gas, weapons, etc. The air force wants to retire many of these but congress gets really angry about it. 

* Various upgrades and productions of the M1 Abrams. The abrams is an excellent tank and congress fights hard for it in domestic and foreign sales. However, we have a lot of them and the army would like to put more in storage or retire more because they're very expensive to keep going. The marine corps finally got rid of all of theirs after years because *you don't need main battle tanks to go island hopping*.  

* lots of old vehicles in storage, including a lot of mid cold war stuff that would get destroyed on a modern battlefield. 

* troops and personnel - the DOD wants to downsize for a while and have some room to knock down buildings, train troops more, and not be on a full war footing. Congress is not happy about that. 

Congress refuses to get rid of shit a lot because it makes their districts money, it's good for their elections, and they don't want to be the ones downsizing the military. However, if there's one area that will make us safer and more cost effective, it's new nuclear treaties. 

Nuclear weapons are absurdly expensive. they cost more than you could imagine, and we have a lot of them. Historically, treaties like SALT and new START have been massive cost savers for us. We need congress and the white house to continue to negotiate with foreign powers, especially china and russia, to reduce their stockpiles with us. maintaining the nuclear stockpile costs us almost 700 billion a year. We could cut out thousands of warheads and save ourselves billions while making the world a better place.",-1

Most likely the cop was cultivating a relationship with a (known in government circles) LE cooperator. I absolutely GUARANTEE though, the right wing media apparatus is going to go full tilt into a narrative that the Proud Boys, and thus all actions by all of them on Jan6 were entrapment or that agents provocateurs were behind the insurrection.

Strap in for this cop to get blamed as the man behind the insurrection. Same thing happened w/Epps (who actually wasnt even a fed). I understand there were undercover law enforcement in the crowd that day gathering intelligence, which is normal for most large public gatherings where violence is likely. Im not sure I understand why the govt even brought this point up and put their own officer as an expert witness that police dont do this. Only thing I can think is they did it to get ahead of any leaks that could frame it as a huge scandal and prove that the nefarious govt intelligence operators were behind the riot.

Nixon was actually becoming a problem for the Republican Party. if I remember correctly upcoming elections depended on a more diverse electorate as such Republicans could no longer afford to defend him as the general election was coming up. In the beginning of the hearings it was the primary season and supporting him was necessary. Something that just isn’t the case now as Gerrymandering has a bigger part to play in the dynamics today. Not only that the electorate especially on the Republic side is extremely entrenched with a base that has a stranglehold especially during their primaries and the electorate is more vindictive now just look at those who voted to impeach Trump as they are out of a job now. Pretty sure that’s not what happened after Nixon resigned. Gerrymandering pretty much eliminates competing against the opposition, but you need to worry more about someone in your own party.

4619,"From the article:

What happens when Florida and Texas blacklist Wall Street’s largest municipal bond underwriters because of their support for environmental, social and governance practices? The answer is a hidden tax foisted on their residents amounting to hundreds of millions of additional dollars.

If socialism means state control of production, distribution and exchange of goods and services, then Florida and Texas fit the description. That’s not the case with California, whose embrace of ESG and free markets has allowed it to borrow more cheaply than Florida and Texas even though it has lower credit ratings. Superior demand makes California debt the outstanding performer among the three largest US states.

Companies committed to ESG favor protection of natural resources, human rights, health and safety, community engagement, transparency, compliance with regulatory policies, diversity, equity and inclusion. Investors like the potential. Asset allocation based on ESG criteria has grown to be at least a $35 trillion industry, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. The iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF has expanded 3,400 times to $20 billion since its inception in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. No less than Larry Fink, chairman, chief executive officer and co-founder of BlackRock Inc., whose $10 trillion in assets makes it the largest money manager, is a believer. He told his shareholders that Wall Street’s embrace of ESG is “capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers and communities your company relies on to prosper.”  Elected officials in Florida and Texas, not to mention half a dozen other states which voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, don’t want their residents to believe that. They decry ESG as “woke,” ignoring its original meaning (as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Stephen Carter explained) as a watchword for Black Americans derived from a Mississippi Delta blues song warning euphemistically of labor exploitation in the early 20th century mills. These southern states, where  racist laws prevailed 50 years ago, now prohibit the biggest Wall Street banks from arranging and selling their new bond offerings because they’re “woke,” often assigning the job smaller firms that may not have the resources or reach to ensure that the borrowers are getting the lowest possible borrowing costs. In Texas alone, the state’s municipal borrowers are paying as much as $532 million more in borrowing costs because of Republican lawmakers’ war with Wall Street over ESG, according to a paper published last year by Daniel Garrett, a University of Pennsylvania professor, and Ivan Ivanov, a principal economist at the Federal Reserve.  Citigroup Inc. initially was excluded from handling a bond sale by the Lone Star state after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, himself indicted five years ago on still unsettled felony securities law charges, determined the bank “discriminates” against the firearms industry. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., with 25,500 Texas employees (the most in any state outside New York), were similarly barred over their support for gun safety regulations and alternative energy. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan managed $540 billion of municipal offerings during the past five years, or 25% of the market for new issues, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average 0.38% fee the banks charged were 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, lower than the average for 145 underwriters.  Since it began its assault on ESG in 2022, Texas, with its perfect AAA credit rating, is paying 19 basis points more in yield (the equivalent of $1.9 million on every $1 billion of bonds sold) than AA rated California on routine borrowings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sudden cheapening of Texas debt is a marked contrast to the zero average spread between Texas and California new debt issues since 2005, when such data initially was compiled. The city of Anna, Texas, in September paid more than it should have on two bond sales totaling almost $100 million when it rejected the most competitive bid from Citigroup because of the Republican-backed state law punishing financial firms for promoting gun safety.  With JPMorgan, a major employer in the state through its acquisitions of Texas Commerce and First National Bank of Houston in the last century, Texas now is biting the hand that feeds it. JPMorgan contributed more than $17.5 million to non-profit workforce readiness programs, community development and neighborhood revitalization in 2019 and continues to expand its main Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio workforce among the hundreds of branches in 130 Texas locations throughout the state.Florida became a visible antagonist of ESG last year when Governor Ron DeSantis revoked Walt Disney Co.’s special tax and self-governing privileges after the state’s largest private employer criticized the DeSantis law prohibiting classroom instruction about sexual orientation. DeSantis then redrew a congressional map diminishing Black representation, fired the elected state prosecutor of Tampa for refusing to enforce the state’s 15-week abortion ban, announced new election police that later charged 20 people for mistakenly voting in 2020 in a deceptive crackdown on insignificant voter fraud, and rounding up Venezuelan asylum seekers in San Antonio and sending them on private planes to Massachusetts at the expense of Florida taxpayers.Most recently, DeSantis barred high school students from taking an Advanced Placement course in African American history on the 100-year anniversary of the Rosewood Massacre, the racially motivated murder and destruction of a Florida community. He is simultaneously defunding diversity programs at state colleges and universities while ousting the president of New College of Florida and closing the diversity offices at the public liberal arts institution in Sarasota.  DeSantis now attacks the giants of money management and securities underwriting for opposing fossil fuel, voter suppression and the criminalizing of reproductive rights as they promote investment strategies furthering sustainability, the essential pillar of ESG. For all his venom toward ESG, DeSantis is poisoning the market for AAA rated Florida debt. Shorn of the liquidity that comes from a robust group of underwriters, Florida now pays 43 basis points more in yield (or $4.3 million for every $1 billion of bonds sold) than California with an inferior credit rating, or 0.35% more than it did prior to 2022. The Florida deterioration is a record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This is what happens when socialism comes to the Lone Star and Sunshine States.--With assistance from Shin Pei and Matthew Himel.

The EPA has released a draft of its annual inventory, which found that US greenhouse gas emissions rose 5.5 percent in 2021 from the previous year, an all-time year-over-year spike, though they were still below 2019 levels. The report found that the increase was largely driven by increased auto emissions as driving rebounded in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fossil fuel combustion-related emissions increased 7 percent relative to the year before, while emissions from coal consumption rose 14.6 percent. In 2021, methane emissions comprised 11.5 percent of emissions, and have declined 16.3 percent since 1990. Electric power demand also increased 2.1 percent from 2020 to 2021, for an overall emissions increase of 7.1 percent.",-1

I'm not going to argue that assessed as an individual event, a school shooter not getting top tier medical care is or is not a moral priority, but there are very real slippery slope risks here. You are essentially already arguing blocking care for people who are in prison for being homeless (and a lot of trans people are) on the basis of 'but what if someone bad also gets healthcare?' That will probably turn into 'why should people on medicaid get to have care? They should stop being poor first.' Then that turns into letting private insurance not cover it, which turns into making it not considered medical care, which makes it easier to ban. Which is a thing states are currently trying to do. This is being used as a wedge issue to spur democratic infighting by targeting the people that the more socially conservative dems don't want to stand up for. But it wont stop there.

Google needs to remove copyrighted material when requested to not be held liable for others posting it.  They are not especially good at this but they aren't held directly liable.  If something is copyrighted is provable by someone claiming it.  There's a whole conversation here around this being abused but it's besides the point.  The issue is largely cut and dry and nothing at all like what is being discussed here. 

The courts have already found before section 230 went into place that having moderation in fact does make you liable and not having moderation makes you not liable. What you're claiming is reasonable is on direct odds with what the courts have actually done.

If anything that someone posts COULD cost a company millions or even tens of thousands in damages, they just aren't going to allow users to post content.  It's not worth it.

If you can't explicitly define ""reasonable efforts"" they are going to always be at risk.  Even if they win a court case, the costs will be massive.

>When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

If you don't have a plug, you buy Delta. There's also the consideration of federal employees—of which there's a shit load up here—who are legally prohibited from using ""regular"" THC, but aren't restricted by federal law against using alts*. Of course, drug testing will catch it, but if your specific employment doesn't random test then your main consideration will be federal law.

The state restricting non-Δ9 cuts off federal employees entirely, even if we got dispensaries all over.

At a time where federal legalization is as close as its ever been (although still too far away), and the 2018 Farm Bill having relaxed restrictions & proliferating cannabinoids everywhere, it's a relevant thing to mention. Until the feds get off their ass on cannabis, delta-8 etc. are the only option for plenty of people, federal or plug-less.

Genesis 19:33-36
  
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
  

  
2 Samuel 13:11-14
  
Now when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”
  

  
But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.” However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.
  

  
1 Samuel 18:25-27
  
Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.
  

  
When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
  

  
Deuteronomy 22:23-24
  
If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.
  

  
Judges 19:22-29
  
While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.”
  

  
The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don’t do this outrageous thing. Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don’t do such an outrageous thing.”
  

  
But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.
  

  
When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
  

  
When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.",-1

5054,"A little more context: The Utah Metropolitan Ballet has done a free performance of the Nutcracker for families of autistic children every year for a decade.

They have wanted to expand to offering other free shows, but with all the costs involved (tens of thousands of dollars) they could not afford to.

I heard about these shows a couple of years ago while I was a guest at their annual charity dinner and auction. I was really moved by the stories of families who had the first opportunity ever to go to a show with their autistic children where they can make noise, or stand up, or walk the aisle without being judged. Multiple members of my extended family are autistic and I thought about how much that experience would mean to them.

Long story short, I was asked for feedback for improving their fundraising after the event I attended, and gave some. They must have appreciated it, because they requested a follow-up meeting. Now, a year and a half later, I'm an honorary board member of a ballet, which my wife finds hilarious as the last time I went to the ballet was over 25 years ago when I was in grade school.

I had a connection with the cookie company as I've spent the last year developing a card game featuring their cookies. When I heard that the ballet was hoping to offer a free performance of their upcoming show, Peter Pan, the cookie company came to mind as a great potential sponsor, and it turns out they were!

I didn't get any compensation for establishing this connection, which means that I get the best benefit of all. The satisfaction of seeing an opportunity to do a little good, and more bravery to pursue the next opportunity for good I see in the future.",1

5118,">Federal prosecutors have taken a ""bold"" and significant step in attempting to get one of Donald Trump's lawyers to answer questions about the classified documents found at the former president's home by circumnavigating attorney-client privilege, a legal expert has said.

>Jack Smith, the special counsel leading the investigation into the sensitive materials found at Mar-a-Lago, is reportedly seeking to compel Trump attorney Evan Corcoran to further testify to a grand jury.

>Corcoran has already answered questions in front of the Washington, D.C. grand jury as part of the investigation, but asserted attorney-client privilege to refuse to answer certain questions, reported The New York Times.

>Attorney-client privilege is one of the most protected privileges there is and allows legal communications between a lawyer and their client to be confidential.

>However, attorney-client privilege is voided under what is known as the crime-fraud exception, meaning it cannot be cited if a lawyer and his client are allegedly attempting to cover up or engage in a crime.

>The Department of Justice is said to have cited crime-fraud exception in a sealed motion to Beryl Howell, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, indicating that it believes Trump or one of his allies may have used Corcoran's service to commit a crime.

>""This is a bold escalation by Jack Smith to avoid the attorney/client privilege and otherwise, non-answers from Trump's lawyer,"" Andrew Lieb, attorney and managing partner of Lieb at Law, P.C., told Newsweek.

>""If Judge Howell finds that the crime-fraud exception applies, she will have ruled that Trump's attorney's conversations with him are not protected from disclosure.""

>Lieb added that without such a ruling, there ""would be no point"" in the special counsel trying to question a lawyer as they merely could cite attorney-client privilege instead of responding.

>""Regardless of what Judge Howell rules, expect an appeal as this is a big turning point in the case,"" Lieb said.

>It is unclear what questions Corcoran refused to answer during his previous appearance before the grand jury, nor what crime specifically the DoJ thinks he is connected to.

>Trump is accused of mishandling the classified materials found at his Florida home in August 2022, as well as purposely obstructing the federal attempt to retrieve all the documents.

>It was previously reported that Corcoran drafted a letter to federal prosecutors, signed by fellow Trump attorney Christina Bobb, in June 2022, assuring that all classified documents had been handed over after the FBI issued a subpoena for their return.

>In August, FBI agents raided Trump's Florida home, seizing more than 100 classified and top secret documents including some found inside a storage room which Trump's lawyers are said to have ""explicitly prohibited"" federal agents from searching in June.

The ""drag bans"", the ""bathroom bills"", the attacks on trans youth and increasingly adult's medical care, the attempts to pull information about LGBTQ but especially trans people from public scools and libraries, and everything else they're doing, they're working towards making the public existence of trans and gender nonconforming people a sex crime.

They see our existence as inherently sexual, and our clothing and gender presentation as the expression of a perverse fetish. If we are anywhere in public where a child might possibly see us, even if it's standing in line at the 7-11, they are claiming that this is pedophilic grooming through forcibly exposing children to degenerate sexual activity.

And they aren't going to fucking stop voluntarily. We are *really fucking useful* to them as a political boogieman. There is no goddamn line where they will decide they've gone far enough, except the point at which we no longer exist.

5281,"Conservatives and Republicans do this kind of culture war shit because they know their policies are unpopular.

They want to curb or end Social Security and Medicaid/Medicare. They want to repeal the ACA including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions and extended coverage for children on their parent's policies. They want to make employers less accountable for keeping employees safe and make big polluters less accountable for poisoning our air, water, and soil.

This is inimical to the interests of much of their working-class base, which lives in rural areas and depend on federal aid money. 

Republicans know this and are constantly two-faced about it. They want to give tax cuts to the rich and strip aid to the poor, but they don't want to tell you that up front. They want to ""sunset"" all laws every five years (Rick Scott), or ""block grant"" aid (so red states can decide not to spend it), or ""privatize"" certain services (i.e. fuck you over for profit).

Anyway, if Republicans were honest about that, then they'd have fewer voters. 

So they fight the culture wars and ban books and rail against ""woke,"" a term barely anyone genuinely uses.

If they can keep hatred and fear stoked, then it matters less if they have an affirmative plan that will actually make things better.

5286,"did you mean this one?

Hey, did you know that in terms of  male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible  Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is  mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and  63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human  dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid  Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based  biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be  incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours  without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll  eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide  nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With  their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover  from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close with this  level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can  make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human  dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take  cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.

However,  screw the female version. You get those same ol' two holes in literally  everything else. The male Vappy is the real star of the show.

Those  long slippery dicks; they have full mobility control and like a  tentacle are the perfect ass filler for the ultimate in-deep reaching  experience nothing else could possibly provide. Naturally lubed at all  times due to their aquatic hydrodynamic nature, you can pull out  anywhere to the side of the road or go into a public restroom at the  beach; get each other aroused, and have the fuck of a lifetime. The  extraordinary squishyness of the Vappy alone rubbing against you would  be enough to lose yourself in pleasure as it simply mounts you. Let  alone as that perfect tool of pleasure slips into you, it's ability to  snake around your bends and its perfect length make it seem that a Vappy  dick was made specifically for your booty. Enjoy the feeling of being  completely filled while also being able to see it if you have a tight  tummy.

And that's only the dick; due to having internal balls,  they're much bigger and pack a lot more cream to load you up with, along  with having muscles around them to make sure every drop comes out while  also being a lot more powerful than any external balls could ever hope  to achieve, giving you a deep, complete filling to rock your world to  your literal core, and beyond.

There's still more though; due to  having a thick, powerful tail connected from their back and front, that  means all their fun stuff is on the front and easy to access. Meaning,  if you were even comfortable with having your dick point backwards  (takes some training), you can be fucked, while also fucking your Vappy  at the same time! Meowth, that's fucking right!

But, but, but!  There's still fucking more! Like, holy shit, male Vaps are the gods of  fuck. While you're fucking your male Vappy, possibly while also being  fucked by him, their booty is on their tail at the base, which is the  thickest part, because that's where the biggest muscles are. This means  that while your dick is in there, it's being fucking massaged, better  than even a vag could achieve! Agh! It should be fucking illegal because  how amazing male Vaps are for fuck!

Well guess what? That only  covered you being a softy, wholesome fucker like me. That's right.  There's. Even. Fucking. More! Say you like to be a little restrained:  you don't need a Sylveon's feelers for that, or an Umbreon/Espeon's  psychic powers, or Leafeon's vines. Vappies got that shit covered too!  Did you even see that tail?! It's basically a boa constrictor. In a  non-sexual sense, it's my favorite part of a Vappy. It's basically their  main part about them. But, if you want them to, it can be a super  useful tool to enhance your knotty experience with them. Despite the  slippyness, you won't be going anywhere if the Vappy wraps you up in  that thing.

Are you a super kinkster? Do you like pure fantasy  fetishes that aren't possible IRL? Such as, say, soft vore? Well guess  fucking what. It just became possible! They can be solid as they pass  your lips (past where your eyes can see them) and turn into water as  they enter you, allowing them to fit perfectly, 'cuz nothing fits into  any spot more perfectly than water, except air like a ghost type. But  who wants to do knotty shit with air? You can't feel it unless it's  moving; you can always feel liquids. Speaking of liquids, even if you're  a weirdo who likes digestion, don't worry about killing them with  absorption. Eventually, they'll come back out and be able to reform like  nothing happened. Speaking of hurting them, if you get too rough, or  you're a horrible abusive asshole to them on purpose for your own  pleasure (QnQ), they can just turn to water and reform back to their  completely unscathed body, making scars or missing pieces a thing of the  past!

I would love to say there's even more you can do with them,  but the possibilities are damn near endless. Use your imagination. But  if you get one, you better show this god of fuck the respect it  deserves. Umbreons maybe my favorite but, damn, Vappies really want to  get that top spot from me. It's a really close call.",0

It instantly connects callers with operators who can help with crisis counseling and other important services.

Don’t hesitate to call.

Edit: added more info below from @SulkyVirus, a mental health provider

“A point of clarity - the 911 for mental health is still 911

988 is for if you are not feeling like you are in a good spot and need support when you are alone or feeling alone and need someone to talk to. It's for suicidal ideation thoughts.

If you are seconds away from ending your life call 911.

If you feel you are in immediate danger don't use 988. Call 911. They are trained in supporting mental health emergencies. 988 are trained as well but act as a triage support to either get someone connected to a long term service, an immediate treatment facility, or emergency services - in which case they will connect you with 911.

Knee jerk reactions of ""ban guns"" is a non-starter, thanks to the 2nd Amendment, and that's not going anywhere.

So what could have been done in this case?

Shooter had been arrested on a felony gun conviction, pled guilty to a misdemeanor, did his time and probation and was therefore allowed to buy the two guns he used in the shooting.

Neither weapon was an ""assault weapon"" so that ban would not apply. One gun came standard with a 12 round magazine, the other 8, so a 10 round limit would not have made any effective difference at all. 2x10 = 12+8.  

So a couple of things...

Maybe we shouldn't allow plea deals for gun based felonies? Ya think? If he had been convicted on the felony charge, he would have been blocked from buying the new guns.

Maybe we should include arrests and charges in background checks and not just convictions? If someone has been arrested 14 times for various gun violations but never convicted, should that be a disqualifying factor?

He had a habit of pointing the gun out his window and firing randomly. Told his dad they were just fireworks. Speaks to his mental state. Again, cops called multiple times, no arrests, no convictions.

In that case, Benton, after pleading that he had reformed and had a family to support, was sentenced to home confinement. Just six days later, the Trump fundraiser at which Vasilenko met Trump took place. A few weeks after that, Benton was caught in an undercover sting orchestrated by the British newspaper The Telegraph, whose reporters posed as representatives of a Chinese businessman who wanted to donate $2 million to Trump’s campaign. Benton told them he could arrange it. He apparently violated the terms of his home confinement in the Iowa case to meet with the undercover reporters.",0

5938,"> What did the DoJ do for a year and half?

Garland harnessed an enormous team of prosecutors from DC and every FBI field office  across the country, plus ""borrowed"" prosecutors from most state attorney offices, to conduct the largest, most complex, and most resource-intensive investigation in DOJ history. 

They issued over 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants, seized approximately 2,000 devices, pored through over 20,000 hours of video footage, searched through an estimated 15 terabytes of data, impaneled dozens of grand juries, and processed over 300,000 tips from citizens.  

They identified and arrested and charged over 700 criminals from every state for their roles on January 6 (just in the first year, the number is larger now).  They did the investigative groundwork to charge several militants with Seditious Conspiracy, which later resulted in several convictions.  They charged more criminals in one year than in the previous five years combined, and they did this all during a pandemic when many courthouses were out of commission.  

People here love to say ""derp, but that was only low-level henchmen, what was he doing all that time"" but people who say that are *fucking morons*.  The rapid roundup of hundreds of rioters and insurrectionists was probably the most incredible and effective coordination/harnessing of nationwide federal prosecution power in history.  There will be history books and law courses dedicated to studying what the DOJ accomplished in that first year alone.   And that was when Garland was ""the new guy!""  Talk about hitting the ground running.  

People also overlook an incredibly important detail.  If there's *any chance* of holding Trump accountable for the violence at the Capitol, you need evidence and testimony from the people *who were involved in the violence at the Capitol.*  In the process of convicting all those Capitol-stormers, Garland got hundreds of people to testify on the record that Trump incited them to do it.   He secured many Obstruction of an Official Proceeding convictions from people who confessed they tried to stop the election certification on Trump's behalf.  He secured convictions of people who committed violence against Capitol police officers while waving Trump flags.  He proved, through convictions, that some of the militants at the Capitol were Conspired Seditiously to obstruct Congress and keep Trump in power.  So all those ""low level henchmen"" convictions and testimony are the start of a firm legal foundation demonstrating that at least a portion of the riot was indeed an insurrection, and that it was indisputably caused by Trump's words and actions.  

Unfortunately I think convicting Trump of Incitement of Insurrection is still a long shot.  Incitement is notoriously hard to prove in court (even when it's *plainly obvious* to the naked eye), and proving Insurrection is basically unprecedented.  But if the DOJ does take this shot, the case will be built upon the foundation they established with all these ""low level"" convictions.  *There is no path to convicting Trump for Capitol violence without them*, so people who scoff at these ""low level"" convictions are really short-sighted.  

>The DoJ learned new information at both the Jan 6 congressional hearings and from the Fulton GA cases. Some of it was already partially public. Why would that be?

Because this is inevitable when there are two or more concurrent investigations.  Especially when one investigation is working from the ground up to build a firm foundation for prosecuting every level of a massive conspiracy, while another is looking exclusively at the top level.  

>Garland has said he is trying to de-politicize the DoJ, but he has effectively created an unofficial immunity by swinging so far into the side of “caution” that none of the people actually responsible for this mess will be prosecuted

Citation needed.  There is absolutely no reason or justification to claim that ""none of the people responsible for this mess will be prosecuted.""  Quite the contrary: they are still investigating, filing subpoenas for evidence, testimony, financial records, etc.  The DOJ investigates for one reason alone: to find evidence of crimes.  The fact that they are steadily moving forward in their investigation is a clear signal that they believe prosecutable crimes occurred.  

Most of the largest RICO investigations in recent history have taken 3-5 years to build to top-level indictments.  None of them compare in size and complexity to the 2020 election conspiracy.  It is ridiculously premature to suggest ""nothing will happen"" after *only 2 years*, when the DOJ has siezed records, testimony, electronics, communications from nearly every Trump lawyer, aide, and advisor, and from his PAC and nearly everyone involved in financing or planning the Jan 6 rally and other ""stop the steal"" events, and nearly everybody with any connection to the fake elector scheme and the plot to delay certification of the vote.  

**TL;DR  If Garland drove to the grocery store, bought milk, flour, eggs, sugar, chocolate chips, and butter, then drove home, got out some bowls, utensils, mixing supplies, then mixed the ingredients thoroughly, and then called Jack Smith, who drove to Garland's house, preheated the oven, greased a cookie sheet, and started laying out spoonfuls of the mixture on to the sheet, you would have to be insane or a liar to claim ""it's already been 2 hours, those cowards have no intention of making cookies.""**",0

So, a class like this can focus more narrowly on African American history and the impacts they had on this country.  We ignore what happened to black people in this country.  For instance, Tulsa, Oklahoma was known as Black Wall Street during the 1920s.  However, a race riot and massacre occurred there where upwards of 250 people, mostly blacks, were killed.  This entirely changed the economy of Tulsa.  That is something you will find in no general US history textbooks, and was something I didn't learn about until I was probably in my mid-twenties.

6140,">DALLAS (AP) — Justice Department officials in Washington have taken over the corruption investigation into Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, removing the case from the hands of the federal prosecutors in Texas who’d long been leading the probe, according to state prosecutors.

>The move is the latest development in the federal investigation into Paxton, who came under FBI scrutiny in 2020 after his own top deputies accused him of bribery and abusing his office to help one of his campaign contributors, who also employed a woman with whom the attorney general acknowledged having had an extramarital affair.

>The investigation of the three-term Republican is now being led by the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes allegations of official misconduct against elected leaders at the local, state and federal level. The U.S. attorney’s office in Texas was recently recused from the complex case after working on it for years — an abrupt change that came within days of Paxton agreeing to apologize and pay $3.3 million in taxpayer money to four of the former staffers who reported him to the FBI.

6141,There is so much to this story left unturned. I need to see more!,0
6142,"Haven’t seen it yet so I’ll explain…

In mathematics, there are a infinite integers and infinite real numbers. The difference is that you can COUNT integers. 

Think about it this way… you know what the next integer is after 2? It’s 3. Integers are basically whole numbers with negative possibilities. So it goes … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4… 1324, 1325… 78920, 78921… and so on. It’s every whole number. Thus, COUNTABLE! You can always find the next integer going positive or negative. 

But what about real numbers? Well… then we get to decimals. So you get 12134.5, 12134…. Wait… what’s the next possible real number? 

Well I’m glad you asked!!! We see this dilemma and call it’s bluff. It’s some finite-decimal number of 12134.0000000000000000000000000….. 0000000000000…. 0000000…. 00000000…. 00000000… 00000…


0000…..




0000… 000001.


You’re still here? Good. 

We see here that you can’t COUNT a real number, per se. You don’t know it’s next adjacent neighbor because there’s an INFINITE amount of zeroes that could iterate before it. But you can COUNT the number of zeroes because that number is an INTEGER!! 

Okay, almost done. 

See, you cannot count real numbers one by one until the day is all done. It is UNCOUNTABLE. The real number line is UNCOUNTABLE. Whereas… the integer line is totally COUNTABLE!

So to wrap things up…. 

There are an infinite number of countable integers, and an infinite number of uncountable real numbers.

2. Identification of enemies as a unifying cause (liberals, Jews, Blacks, immigrants, gays, etc.)
2. Rampant sexism (male Republicans now control women's bodies)
2. Controlled mass media (Fox News)
2. Obsession with national security (24/7 panic over a Chinese balloon that will 'destroy America' if not shot down immediately!)
2. Religion and government intertwined (Nationalist Christians aka Nat-Cs preaching from the pulpit for the flock to vote Republican and that Democrats are demons)
2. Corporate power protected (GOP justices allow unlimited 'dark' money into political campaigns so that companies can buy politicians and power)
2. Labor power suppressed (GOP union busting)
2. Disdain for intellectual and the arts (anti-vax, anti-science, anti-NEA)
2. Obsession with crime and punishment (GOP supports the death penalty for driving while Black and believes that immigrants are coming to kill Americans)
2. Rampant cronyism and corruption (trump literally operated a hotel a few Blocks from the WH where Saudis handed him bags of cash, but I suppose that money is dwarfed by the $2b they gave his son-in-law.)",-1

6298,"“The prosecutors have sought approval from a federal judge to invoke what is known as the crime-fraud exception, which allows them to work around attorney-client privilege when they have reason to believe that legal advice or legal services have been used in furthering a crime. The fact that prosecutors invoked the exception in a sealed motion to compel the testimony of the lawyer, M. Evan Corcoran, suggests that they believe Mr. Trump or his allies might have used Mr. Corcoran’s services in that way.

Among the questions that the Justice Department has been examining since last year is whether Mr. Trump or his associates obstructed justice in failing to comply with demands to return a trove of government material he took with him from the White House upon leaving office, including hundreds of documents with classified markings.

Last May, the Justice Department issued a subpoena for any classified documents still in Mr. Trump’s possession, after he had voluntarily turned over an initial batch of material to the National Archives that turned out to include almost 200 classified documents. In June, Mr. Corcoran met with investigators and handed over more than 30 documents in response to the subpoena.

Another lawyer for Mr. Trump, Christina Bobb, then signed a statement asserting that a “diligent search” had been conducted at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s residence and private club in Palm Beach, Fla., and that there were no additional documents bearing classification markings. Ms. Bobb has told investigators and others that Mr. Corcoran drafted the statement, and that she added some caveats to it, seeking to make it sound less ironclad.

But when the F.B.I. searched Mar-a-Lago in August, agents found more than 100 additional classified documents. The affidavit submitted by the Justice Department to obtain the search warrant said that there was “probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction” would be found in the search.”

Power generation 

In the west, we already struggle with this way more than we should for ""developed"" countries 

There are still some areas that have rolling blackouts, people relying on their own power generation, etc.

Not to mention, here in rural ON our politicians decided to have long term contracts in place that pays for the power generated by our wind turbines at ~50% higher than the actual electricity is worth, and ON has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world IIRC 

All this is to say, we don't have the infrastructure. It would be amazing if we did, but at this point in the world there's really not many ways aside from nuclear to be able to produce enough power to supply electricity to half a million charging stations with likely 10+ chargers at each, across America alone, likely being used in perpetuity, is something we cannot sustain, unfortunately. 

We need to build up our world around us if we want to take this seriously.

6480,"You are focused on 14 year olds, which would be the youngest age group that this might be possible for.  However, it is less likely to be available to 14 year olds and is more likely to be available to the older end of that age group.  AP stands for Advanced Placement.  These students have to be eligible for these classes based on a number of factors, one of which being that they often have to have completed pre-requisite courses before being being eligible.  So a student likely has to have passed an algebra class, among others, with a great score to even be eligible for the AP physics class.

These credits are also not necessarily a 1 for 1.  Meaning that just because you took an AP physics class doesn't mean that you don't have to take a physics class in college.  What it typically means is that if you score high enough on your AP exams, you can be granted certain credits to skip introductory courses.  So, a college might require you to take an introductory course such as 'college math,' but with a good enough AP exam score you can opt out of that class.  For me, I was able to skip 'writing I,' as a freshman in college because I had a high enough score to opt out of that.  I had essentially proven with classes and exams that I was advanced enough at that point to not need that introductory class, and I took writing II in my first semester instead of writing I.

With something like African American studies, they likely have to have passed other history courses to even be eligible for these classes.  Again, this is an elective class.  So, they'd still be studying other required history courses as well.  

These courses are 'college level,' so you have to be ready to take college level courses before you're eligible.  Taking them in high school means that you can get through college more quickly and more economically because you can skip having to take the time and to pay for introductory courses that you have shown are not needed.  Being college level courses, they also prepare students for college by teaching them skills that they will use and develop in college (i.e. study habits).",1

When your boss screams at you, you feel angry and embarrassed. But you can't scream back, because he's your boss. So go home and take it out on your wife. Looks like this is either illustrated in the 40s or 50s, or is set in it, so the husband is basically 'the boss' of the household. He screams at the wife because he wants to scream at the boss but can't.

It's her turn to feel anger and embarrassment, so she screams at the child, because that is the person she has power over. She can't scream at her husband because presumably he would slap the shit out of her.

Kid is upset and hurt because mom screamed at him, but he can't scream at her because she's bigger and stronger than he is. So he takes it out on the cat, who is the only creature he can scream at.

My major concern is the states ability to take the labor of another, and give it to someone else who has not labored at all or to simply keep it for itself. Why should I labor if my needs are met for sitting on my ass? Why should I labor if my surplus that I labored for is given to someone who will not and still have thier needs met? Why should I bother if I could sit on my ass instead?

Granted there are those who can not work, I give from what little surplus I have to local charities. Equal labor/skill should be paid equally, you should have your needs met for a days labor, but I cannot and will not finance those who will not help themselves. A corporation has negotiated materials acquisition, work schedules, the work to be done for who and for how much, and if I don't like this corporation I can work for another.

7252,"Americans remain convinced that voting is the only legitimate solution. Mostly because it’s just the easiest and most convenient of all the options.

Anything outside of voting isn’t just looked down upon, Democrats clutch their pearls and screech like Republicans should you insist that more has to be done. If I so much as mention that people need to take some kind of direct action, I get called a fascist who’s “trying to convince people not to vote”. If I talk about the need for civil disobedience it’s “good luck with that”. Should those of us who would stand up and resist even try, our fellow Democrats would handicap us before we ever even get to the fascists themselves.

What can be done when trying to stop fascism is labelled as fascist in and of itself? What are people like myself to do when we are thrown under the bus by the very people we want to help and protect?

My friends, family, neighbors and countrymen are not concerned. They do not believe that fascism is already here, they do not believe it’s coming in the future, and they will wait til there are boots on their doorsteps before they ever acknowledge and reconcile with any of this. Which by then, obviously it’s too late.

Republicans want to hurt and kill other people. Democrats want to rightly *blame* Republicans, but they do not want to *stop* them. It is far too effective to have a boogeyman, and they have a deep fear that should we actually stop these boogeymen, all that will be left is to reflect upon themselves, and they’re scared of what they might see, should there not be anyone worse to focus on.

We had a plague that they told us to sacrifice our lives to make rich people richer, and we did. We had protests where a militarized police force were murdering people on the streets, blinding journalists, and kidnapping protestors. We are staring down the barrel of World War 3 with the conflict in Ukraine, half the country is openly supporting a hostile enemy nation over our own, and one of our Generals is warning of imminent war with China. Women had their rights fucking stolen by religious zealots on the Supreme Court, trans and gay people are being attacked and murdered, and white christian nationalists are attacking our power grids. We have the fucking return of polio, the surge of multiple other viruses and diseases, the highest levels of wealth inequality *ever*, massive levels of “inflation” which is essentially just rampant corporate greed that is embedded at every level of our government. This is just my short list, don’t even get me started on the climate apocalypse hurdling our direction. 

We really don’t have the time to fuck around with *any* of this, but Americans seem to tolerate pretty much all of it. We won’t have the luxury of decades or generations to wait for things to get better or fix what is broken. Everything I ever thought Americans would need to find solidarity and rise up has happened, and more, and yet nothing changed, things only grow worse instead.

This isn’t a message of defeat. This is a message of outrage. If you read all this, you shouldn’t come away with the conclusion that I’m a doomer, this is me being hopeful that being able to recognize and articulate the problem leads people to the solution. Rise up and take the power back. You can’t stop fascists with a ballot, as proven by the whole *gestures broadly at everything*. We have spent decades trying to solve things with a vote, it’s beyond time to recognize that this strategy has objectively failed, and more must be done. 

Organize, unionize, protest, strike, rally, and engage in civil disobedience on a mass scale, or else. If you think “it’s too hard to do any of that right now” think about how much easier it would have been before a plague was spreading and rent was unaffordable. It’s only going to get harder, and our chance of success smaller, the longer we wait. If you think “I can’t afford to right now” you *really* can’t afford not to. Take a look around, take a look at everything I’ve listed, and then realize that people haven’t taken action yet because *we still haven’t hit rock bottom*. Let’s not wait to see what rock bottom looks like.

Americans who simply cast a ballot and then shrug at what happens next do at the risk *of all of us*.",1

* The Attorney General of Georgia has no Constitutional power to step in and stop or take over a county prosecution.
* The RICO laws of Georgia are the most aggressive and prosecutor friendly in the nation.
* DA Fani Willis is a veteran of prosecuting public corruption and racketeering cases.
* We currently do not know if there is a criminal grand jury hearing this case (because they are secret), but rumors are that it is currently under way or is soon to be underway.
* A change of venue is highly unlikely to be granted because of the political leaning of the population of Fulton county where this case would be prosecuted.
* County DAs cannot be removed by the AG, there is a judicial process to disqualify a prosecutor from a case but DAs are elected officials, and home rule is enshrined in the state constitution.
* There is a bill winding its way through committees to make it easier for voters to recall AGs, but it is unlikely to clear the Senate because it is opposed by the state bar association.",1

Despite a special investigation that lasted multiple years, nobody could prove that the Trump administration knowingly or purposely “colluded” with Russia to try and win an election

A special investigation that is far more funded and knowledgeable than you or I, could not prove anything of the such existed.

Despite this. People hilariously still believe that it happened or believe that it’s real. Joy Reid and Rachel Maddow sure did a good job being the hype train leaders

Also Adam Schiff did an excellent “lying Furby” model over the entire time, repeatedly lying about evidence he saw and was in his hands.

I promise you, if Trump colluded with Russia, the special investigation would have brought *all* the charges

If a state were to attempt to secede, the federal government would likely view it as an act of rebellion and respond with force to preserve the union.

The federal government's ability to control military and economic resources would give it a significant advantage over any seceding state.

Each state in the US relies heavily on federal funding, programs, and resources, giving the federal government significant influence and power over individual states.

The federal government's control over resources and funding makes secession a difficult and unlikely option for any state wishing to pursue it.

The idea of automatically sunsetting programs makes it easier cancel programs that help working people. They just sit back and let it happen. Conversely, programs that help already wealthy businesses can be sufficiently lobbied and gives a good pretense for industry bribes to renew a beneficial program.

In summary, the good programs will end over time and the politicians will just complain that there's nothing they could do about it. The bad programs will be necessary to extend to preserve the economy. Politicians willing to give concessions to the rich will get more regular injections of cash to prevent subsidies from sunsetting.",1

I don’t see how not allowing elective procedures would lead our prison systems to bar a prisoner from receiving cancer treatment, heart valve replacement, or other life saving treatment. 

I’m for equal rights, I don’t want special treatment. Why should someone in prison have treatments paid for by taxpayers that my friends who are trans struggle to afford. 

I agree this is a wedge issue, however I grew up with no rights and being gay was literally against the law. I’m pleased with the progress that has been made so far and will continue to fight for equal rights for all LGBTQ people.

I don’t agree with most of this bill, but don’t think it’s fair that prisoners should get special treatment. The reason they are incarcerated is irrelevant, most of your points are issues with our criminal justice system and lack of care for homeless or the mentally ill.

> Supporters say it would help clear the city’s judicial backlog and put more officers on the streets.

Did you ask them how? What provision? 

> “My constituents want to feel safe when they come here,” Lamar has said. “Where I am coming from with this bill is to help the citizens of Jackson.”

What exactly is the point of this quote. Specifically why is it sandwiched between the above quote  and a paragraph about similar battles in other states. Also, why is there not a following ""How?"" behind that quote? 

> The legislation under consideration in Mississippi would expand the Capitol Complex Improvement District, which includes downtown Jackson and nearby areas, to include neighborhoods in northeast Jackson. The jurisdiction of the Capitol Police, which has about 120 officers and protects the district, would expand to reflect the new boundaries.

> The new Capitol Complex Improvement District would include about a third of the city’s 150,000 residents, and while the district would be majority-Black, it would take in 80 percent of Jackson’s White residents, but only about a quarter of its Black residents.

Why these specific borders? How does this achieve the stated goals? Once again, how? The decision by Washingtonpost to include the racial demographics seems like it is intended to have the reader infer a certain conclusion. There could be a legitimate reason (there probably isn't) but we don't know because nobody asked why and how.

> Lamar’s legislation would also create a separate judicial system with two judges appointed by the chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court to oversee both criminal and civil cases within the new district. Judges are elected in the rest of the state. The state attorney general would also appoint the prosecutors, who are elected in the rest of the state, and public defenders.

So I guess I understand that this will expand the number of court cases that can be processed by increasing the number of judges and prosecutors. But why does it need to be in a separate office? Why is it appointed by the State rather than by the residents of this newly expanded special district? So the affluent part of the city, which includes 80% of white residents, is being denied certain democratic rights to self-government? 

> Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has called the bill “plantation politics.” “This is the most overtly racist legislation that Mississippi has presented in some time,” he said in an interview.

How?! 

> Lamar, the bill’s author, says those claiming the legislation is racist are playing politics. “This bill is just designed to help with the crime problem and the backlog in the Hinds County judicial system. That’s the sole intent of the bill,” he said in an interview.

How?!

> Amid criticism, Republicans in the House voted to remove some of its most controversial provisions, including one requiring Jackson to transfer nearly 20 percent of its revenue to the new improvement district.

7894,"> “At what point are either side justified in violence?”

At the point where violence is thrust upon them. 

Spreading a plague that kills and disables people is violence. A militarized police force murdering and assaulting people is violence. The rhetoric that leads gay and trans people to be attacked and murdered is violence. Attacking our power grids is violence. Stealing women’s rights and causing more death and suffering is violence. Corporate greed that creates poverty, the war on drugs, the war on education, unable to afford rent, going hungry because groceries are inflated, all violence.

What is your solution? To simply let violence be thrust upon us, and to have no means to defend ourselves from it? To pretend that one side defending themselves from violence is just as bad as those inflicting the violence upon them? This is the whole “fighting fascism is fascism” mentality I was talking about.

One side is *pretending* that “violence” (like books about gay lifestyles) is being thrust upon them, because they understand that violence being thrust upon you is grounds for defending yourself, with violent means if necessary. Hence why these fascists are already resorting to attacking and killing people. Should we simply tolerate this, it will lead to the destruction of all tolerance going forward.

We have a choice. We can stop the violence, or remain victims. That’s really it. I don’t understand those who insist that the only legitimate or viable solution is to remain victims. The fascists would love nothing more than for us to succumb to their rhetoric that defending ourselves somehow makes us just as bad or worse than they are. Why would we dictate our actions based on what our enemy says? *Of course* they’re going to claim that we shouldn’t defend ourselves from them.",-1

The politicians know and are aware of Fatigue that sets in and how it can change over time. They all built their careers off of it. Lest of all Biden was despised and made fun of just a few decades ago for his continued failed presidential runs, shameless plagiarism scandals, and the kind of politics that made him a bit too chummy with hardened white nationalists but decades later we neither have the collective memory nor do we care that much. He's a changed man we're told and we accept that as a fact. 

I personally don't hate him but if I were to look back on his legacy, it is tarnished with the kind of legislative efforts that creep me out and that would infuriate me if I were any older. As is, I am merely concerned and bemused by the fact that most crises we're dealing with are consequences of his actions and that of his ilk, not that he'll ever personally suffer them. 

We were born later and left unaware of the kind of grave sins that simmer under the surface. Most who were slightly older than Biden passed already and aren't even alive to be pointing fingers. 

That's just Biden and congress is full of politicians like him and worse.

The IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education, and related services to more than 7.5 million (as of school year 2020-21) eligible infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities.

Fox News’s most prominent hosts and top executives agonized behind the scenes in the weeks following the 2020 election as they watched allies of Donald Trump appear on their own airwaves promoting false conspiracy theories about a stolen election, according to internal emails, text messages and depositions excerpted in a new court filing.

“Sidney Powell is lying,” Tucker Carlson wrote to a producer about the Trump lawyer, who once claimed in a guest spot that voting technology companies “flipped” Trump votes to Biden.

“Terrible stuff damaging everybody,” wrote company founder Rupert Murdoch, about wild claims raised by Powell and fellow Trump adviser, Rudy Giuliani. The recipient of his note, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, agreed. In another message, Murdoch referred to the claims as “really crazy stuff” and that it is “very hard to credibly claim foul everywhere.”

And of Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, Fox’s prime time roster seemed to share a common opinion during these fraught weeks.

“[He’s] acting like an insane person,” wrote Sean Hannity, star of the network’s 9 p.m. show, while his 10 p.m. colleague Laura Ingraham concurred: “Such an idiot.”

The messages are part of a cache of internal correspondence and deposition testimony released Thursday in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the network filed by Dominion, one of the two election software companies at the center of the conspiracy theories.

The documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of the cable news network and show how publicly Trump-friendly personalities were privately repulsed by the president’s post-election actions, with Carlson referring to Trump as a “demonic force,” according to the filings.

The filing in Delaware State Superior Court ahead of an April trial is meant to bolster Dominion’s argument that Fox leadership was aware that the claims of election fraud were untrue but nonetheless “spread and endorsed” them, the company argued.

“Not a single Fox witness testified that they believe any of the allegations about Dominion are true,” Dominion argued in the filing. “Indeed, Fox witness after Fox witness declined to assert the allegations’ truth or actually stated they do not believe them, and Fox witnesses repeatedly testified that they have not seen credible evidence to support them.”

Fox’s news staff was just as loud in raising internal concerns as the star pundits and executives, the filings show. In one message, Fox correspondent Lucas Tomlinson wrote to news anchor Bret Baier referring to “dangerously insane” election claims. Baier, in turn, wrote that “there is NO evidence of fraud” and told Bill Sammon, then the network’s Washington bureau chief, that their team must “prevent this stuff,” meaning the spread of misinformation.

In a statement, Fox News downplayed the revelations from the correspondence, saying it was filled with “cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context.”

“There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners,” a spokesperson said, “but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan.”

In a separate counterclaim filing also made public Thursday, Fox alleged that Dominion’s $1.6 billion demand “has no factual support,” arguing that — far from having its value destroyed by Powell and Giuliani’s false claims of fraud — the company is actually “in a solid financial position.”

While much of the correspondence aired by Dominion shows Fox officials agonizing over false information on its airwaves, some of the behind-the-scenes torment was about a story the network got right — an election-night projection that Joe Biden would win the hotly contested state of Arizona.

Fox’s decision-desk analysts were days ahead of other news outlets in making the controversial call, which infuriated Trump and his supporters — including many Fox viewers.

“Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we’ve lost with our audience?” Carlson wrote in a text message to his producer. “We’re playing with fire, for real.”

Scott, who forwarded Carlson’s concerns about the Arizona call to Fox Corp CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch, was quoted as saying that Fox’s “brand” was impacted by the “arrogance” of the early — but accurate — call.

Dominion is using such messages to make the argument that Fox was motivated by competitive pressures from smaller pro-Trump cable stations like Newsmax that threatened to lure away its viewers. Carlson, in his message, specifically warned that Newsmax “could be devastating to us.”

Fox News president Jay Wallace acknowledged in a text message to Scott that it was “a bit troubling” to see Newsmax pick up Fox viewers — an ultimately short-lived gain — adding that the rival network offered “an alternate universe” but that “it can’t be ignored.”

Newsmax “should be watched, if skeptically,” Rupert Murdoch told Scott in a Nov. 16, 2020 email, adding that he doesn’t “want to antagonize Trump further.”

And Scott and Lachlan Murdoch commiserated over how their pro-Trump viewers were “going through the 5 stages of grief,” as Scott put it, promising her corporate boss that Fox would “plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them.” Her boss agreed that a “constant rebuilding without any missteps” was needed after the Arizona call.

“We can fix this,” Scott wrote, “but we cannot smirk at our viewers any longer.”

Dominion’s filings also suggest that Fox brass bristled when its own reporters attempted to push back on election conspiracies on the air. “If this gets picked up, viewers are going to be further disgusted,” Scott wrote in a message after reporter Jacqui Heinrich fact-checked a Trump tweet containing misinformation about Dominion. In a text message, Carlson suggested to Hannity that Heinrich should be fired. Kristen Fisher, then a White House reporter for Fox who has since moved to CNN, testified that her then-boss told her higher-ups were “unhappy” with her own fact-checking segment.

In Fox’s own brief requesting the judge rule in its favor, attorneys argue that Fox showed no “actual malice” — the high standard required in defamation cases — because all of the hosts who allowed false claims to be aired honestly believed there was a chance the election might have been stolen using Dominion’s machines.

“It is hardly unusual that some people in a newsroom (with the diverse political viewpoints one would expect) will disbelieve the allegations and hope that they ultimately prove false,” Fox’s lawyers wrote, “while others will keep an open mind in hopes that they prove true.”

But Hannity, for one, said in a deposition quoted in the Dominion filing that he never believed Powell’s claims. “Nobody ever convinced me that their argument was anywhere near accurate or true.”",-1

Another issue is that Republicans are also pushing forward bills that criminalizes trans people just for existing. Oklahoma pushed for a bill that would fine drag performers up to $20,000 and have them face up to 2 years in jail for performing in front of a minor, but keep the bill vague enough that it could apply to a trans person just being seen in public by a child.

Kristi Noem is trying to thread two political needles.  


She’s desperate to create chatter about a presidential run, while also not angering Donald Trump and excluding herself from his short-list of vice presidential candidates. She’s also trying to do some of Trump’s dirty work by attacking Ron DeSantis, while also not directly attacking the Florida governor and setting off a war with his camp.  


On Wednesday, Noem managed to do it all, delivering a speech at the pro-Trump think tank America First Policy Institute that generated the chatter she craves while also subtly taking shots at DeSantis without using his name.  


Noem’s main line of attack against DeSantis was contrasting their different responses to COVID-19.  


“I did not lock my people down or mandate anything. In fact, we were the only state in the country that never once ordered a single business or church to close,” Noem said at one point during the private event, where Trump alumni Brooke Rollins and Hogan Gidley sat front and center. “In fact, I didn’t even define what an essential business was or nonessential business was.”",-1

Benton kept most of the money for himself but donated $25,000 to the Republican National Committee as part of a plan to secure two tickets to a fundraising event for Trump in Philadelphia. At the event, Vasilenko was allowed to sit close to Trump at a roundtable discussion and later took a photo with him.

The campaign of scandal-plagued Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) is not short on problems, including a reported federal investigation.  


But it is short on one critical thing: money.  


As Santos reportedly weighs whether to run again in 2024, that spells real trouble—because the campaign hasn’t been legally allowed to raise or spend money for nearly two weeks, according to campaign finance experts who have reviewed recent Federal Election Commission filings.  


In a personal Valentine’s Day letter addressed to Santos, the FEC notified him that—as the congressman himself has long known—his old treasurer resigned, and he had a 10-day window to appoint a new one. That resignation was submitted Jan. 31, and, according to the treasurer, was effective as of Jan. 25.  


“At the request of the FEC, I am submitting this Form 99 stating that I have resigned as treasurer for the Devolder-Santos For Congress Committee as of January 25, 2023,” wrote the treasurer, Nancy Marks.  


News reports this week suggested that the FEC’s letter was a warning, giving Santos 10 days to comply or shut down financial activity.  


But the letter itself doesn’t say that, and legal experts told The Daily Beast that the 10-day window appears to have closed on Feb. 4, after Marks’ resignation.",1

He has no charisma, he's very thin skinned.  He seems awkward and uncomfortable outside of situations that haven't been curated specifically for him.  DeSantis has been successful in Florida not because of himself, but because of this hyper-extremist right wing machine that has gathered around him and is propping him up. On his own he's a cowardly opportunist that bends whichever way the wind blows.

Trump on the other hand is like a force of nature.  He tears through anyone who stands in his way and even his own supporters aren't safe around him.  He has a huge name recognition and is, lets face it, very charismatic.  He's entertaining, even the people that hate him tune in to hear what he says.  Meatball is not.  In a head to head match, Trump would destroy him and he knows it.  His focus is on cementing Republican control of Florida because its not as guaranteed as it may seem.

2024 is going to be rough year for Florida Republicans because by then Florida's insurance market will have collapsed, its housing market will have imploded, its school system will have collapsed.  And the hurricane damage from last year will haunt them for years. Nearly every minority group will have turned on them with the escalating attacks on LGBT Floridians, Black Floridians, Jewish Floridians.  Latino Floridians are even starting to think twice now.   The 2 Florida democrat freshman in Congress are making big waves for themselves in the media while the republicans in Congress are making fools of themselves.  If the Florida Democrats field some strong candidates in 2024, its going to be a struggle for the GOP to keep control of the state.

He is like an evil PeeWee Herman, a clueless shameless buffoon who keeps landing on his feet no matter how ridiculous his last misadventure was

A big problem that is starting to surface though is the publicity and scandals around Santos have enticed a frenzy of bottom feeding GOP backroom operatives who understand the influence they can exert via a hapless moron like Santos and the access they can cultivate from being in the inner circle of a clueless, amoral congressman

I think it is important that people know exactly who is getting behind Santos these days and first cab off the rank of right-wing leeches that are latching on to Santos is Vish Burra

Burra, convicted drug dealer and pure MAGA swamp monster was the IT ""brains"" behind the dissemination of the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop back when he was working as a producer on Steve Bannon's podcast

Burra went on to work as a staffer for Matt Gaetz but left when the underage sex scandal surrounding Gaetz started to die off because, as Burra states it, **""If the FBI and the DOJ are no longer coming after you, it’s not a fun job any more""**

Burra took on the role of Director of Operations for Santos in January, after the public started learning about Santos' shady past. When asked if Santos' lies and concerns around his campaign finances was what drew Burra to want to work for Santos he said **""Of course, that's my brand""**. Burra describes what he does as **""activism and institutional infiltration""** and says his operational style is **“two katanas to the neck”**

Burra, in partnership with Gavin Wax, got his start in politics with a takeover of the New York Young Republican Club, turning it into a proto-fascist network with links to a roll call of US and foreign far-right hate groups. The aims of Burra's inner circle were well stated by Wax at an NYYRC event when he said **""We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.""**

Burra is the worst of the worst when it comes to GOP insiders. Whether Santos knows it or not he has been scooped up by the fascists and is now their man in the house, and we can expect some truly awful behaviour from Santos for as long as Burra is behind him pulling the strings",0

Depression is a very common symptom for those who have survived a stroke, particularly a major one like Fetterman. During  his campaign for Senate, Fetterman and his team infamously downplayed just how serious his stroke was, only for them later to admit that he had almost died. While on the campaign trail and most significantly in his debate with Oz it was clear that he was not even close to being recovered. With such major health concerns I don’t see why he is still in office. Before I understood his reasoning for staying in the race as it looked like control of the Senate could come down to who won in Pennsylvania and him bowing out so close to the election could’ve handed the race to Oz, but now if he resigns he’ll be replaced by another Democrat by the governor. He should be at home recovering with his family and not in a highly stressful job with long-hours like a Senator.",0

Gun control is an evergreen political fight for the Democrats. They sabotage their own gun control legislation the same way Republicans do with immigration laws - there's always something pointless and dumb enough to guarantee a blustery death in Congress. Right now its AR-15s, a pointless aesthetic fixation that derails *actual* gun control reform. This works wonderfully for the GOP, who know they'll never have to even think about their single-issue 2A voters.

9210,"Here is the beginning of the story: 

He has a flat-top haircut, seven fingers after a meat grinder accident, and a Twitter profile picture of him in a baseball cap and stained “Hellgate” hoodie.  


Sen. Jon Tester is hardly the portrait of an average D.C. politician. But in Montana, he’s almost certainly the Democrats’ best hope of retaining their seat in Big Sky Country.  


The only problem is, as of this moment, he’s undecided on if he’s going to run for re-election.  


Tester’s current term is up in 2024, a year where the Democrats’ Senate map is rife with opportunities for losses and virtually no pickups. Democrats will be defending their Senate seats in swing states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Ohio—in addition to their red-state seats in West Virginia and Montana.  


Democrats across the state seem sure Tester is their best shot at beating Republicans for the crucial Senate seat. He’s a moderate with a farmboy appeal who’s managed to win over Republicans and independents in the past. But with a very real possibility of retirement from Tester, Montana Democrats can’t necessarily count on his prowess this time around.  


And yet, in calls to Montana Democrats this month, The Daily Beast couldn’t find any sign of a plan B. For many, it’s Tester or bust.  


“Jon’s the only Democrat who can win here. And that’s been settled for quite a while,” said Tom Winter, a Democrat who ran for Congress in Montana last year.",1

The NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) reports ruthless exploitation and forced labour on the oil palm plantations. A huge portion of the plantation workers - around 840,000 People- are immigrants from Indonesia without legal status. Part of that are an estimated 50,000 to 200,000 children. Due to the precarious situation of their parents is child labour on the plantations, who supply the oil mills, very widespread;

Child labour in Ghana and the Ivory Coast - where 70% of the worldwide produced cocoa comes from - is against the law. But enforcing that is next to impossible.

In Minnesota you'll find a large Scandinavian population.  In the Appalachian Mountains you'll find a lot of Scots-Irish people who still speak very similarly to their ancestors.  In the Southwest you'll find a much larger Hispanic population.  The Southeast has been significantly influenced by African and African American culture, despite their enslavement.  A place like Louisiana is almost entirely its own thing with French and African influences.  

All of these people and places have their own cultures in so many ways and are often adverse to outsiders.  You often see people of different cultures being adverse to others moving to their regions.  The southeast is especially notorious for this with a, ""damn Yankees,"" attitude.",-1

Here's my take: Republicans will push more and more for Christian nationalism, which will galvanize their base and remove all philosophical diversity from the party. But it will also cost them support, as people reject the extremism. 

The question is not if they can win elections if they become a monolithic authoritarian body, the question is can they win enough to undo democracy and remain in power through other means while they do it. 

They'd never win fair elections as a Christian nationalist party in enough numbers to have control. They'd just keep control of the reddest states and Dems would have a permanent national majority. That is why they are moving to make new Jim Crow type laws, push propaganda, and ""legally"" rig elections any way they can. When they get more power, they will use that power to further corrupt the system to stay in power - that is what is happening in Florida right now, and it's how authoritarian regimes work. Power is the only real priority. Democracy is a check on that, so they will reject democracy.",1

9425,">The newly disclosed messages are part of a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the media giant; Dominion Voting Systems is seeking damages from Fox News over its coverage in the aftermath of the election. Hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham, as well as others, disparage Trump henchmen, including  Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani in messages — casting doubt on claims that Dominion’s voting machines had rigged the presidential election in Joe Biden’s favor, according to the legal filing made public on Thursday.  
The company also alleges that Fox News hosts Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and Sean Hannity gave Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani a platform to lie about the voting process.   
“Fox knew,” the Dominion filing states, which cited excerpts from evidence collected in the suit. “From the top down, Fox knew ‘the Dominion stuff’ was ‘total BS.’ The filing includes text messages, internal emails, and depositions Dominion gathered via discovery from Fox News over the past few months.  
On Nov. 13, per the document, Carlson texted one of his producers that Trump needed to concede “that there wasn’t enough fraud to change the outcome” of the election, and later texted that Sidney Powell, one of Trump’s lawyers, was “lying” about having evidence for election fraud.  
In another text exchange a few days later, as stated in the legal filing, Carlson repeated his concerns to Ingraham, writing that “Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It’s insane.” Ingraham replied, “Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy.” Carlson responded, “It’s unbelievably offensive to me. Our viewers are good people and they believe it.”  
The filing also alleges that Powell told Fox employees and Maria Bartiromo that she relied on sources that made her unreliable. The suit states that before Powell’s Nov. 8 appearance on Bartiromo’s Sunday Morning Futures show, the “evidence” Powell provided to back her false accusations that the voting company manipulated the election was from an individual who described herself as “internally decapitated” and capable of “time travel in a semi-conscious state.”  
On Jan. 6, Carlson messaged the same producer, and called Trump “a demonic force, a destroyer, adding, “But he’s not going to destroy us.”",-1

The far right wants to suppress speech that they think will lead people to adopt leftist views and perspectives. And the farther they drift to the right, the more ideas seem ""lefitst."" Eventually anything that isn't literally parroting their views will be seen as ""leftist indoctrination"", and in need of suppression. 

Meanwhile, the far left wants to suppress any speech that they deem ""harmful,"" which could really include anything. And the more these censors succceed in silencing speech they find offensive, the more sensitive they become. Eventually anything that isn't literally parroting their views (with the approriate neologisms) will be seen as ""harmful,"" and in need of suppression.

Things can get very extreme very fast when people aren't allowed to talk to each other and aren't allowed to question ideas.

>	[…]

>	The laws are manifestly incoherent. The failure to teach about structural racism will make Black children born into poverty feel that their parents and grandparents are responsible for their own impoverished position relative to white children, and so will make Black children feel “anguish or other forms of psychological distress” because of “actions … committed in the past by other members of the same race”. The “anguish” and “psychological distress” these laws forbid are only anguish felt by the dominant racial group, white Americans.

>	In other national contexts, everyone would clearly recognize the problematic nature of laws of this sort. Germany’s teaching of its Nazi past creates clear anguish and guilt in German children (and perhaps for this reason, Germany is the world’s most stable liberal democracy). If the German far right passed laws forbidding schools from teaching about the sins of Nazism, on the grounds that such teaching does in fact quite obviously cause anguish and guilt in German children, the world would not stand for it for one moment.

I think both of these points need to be brought up more.  

When you teach that Columbus was a great hero and that indigenous Americans were all savages with no culture worth preserving… that’s a myth that makes white kids feel better but it’s also a direct attack on American Indian children.  

When you teach that Africa had no “precolonial” history, and Africans invented slavery, and slavery in the US south was good for the slaves, and the civil war was about states rights, and racism ended in the 1960s… these are all myths that make white kids feel better but they are also direct attacks on black children.  

And when you teach kids politically motivated myths, lies, and platitudes like this, you keep them from ever being able to grow or to change.  Germany learned that lesson.  Somehow the US never has.",-1

There's another aspect to trans people joining the military too. At a time in their lives (usually late teens/early 20s) when most people aren't 100% sure of their identity (gender, sexual, political, moral, whatever), the military offers a sort of ""fix"" to living with the profound uncertainty of questioning something so socially fundamental as your gender.

The ultra-masculine culture can be used by trans femmes to try to ""give masculinity a shot"" so to speak, and it provides an environment where trans mascs can exist more comfortably in a masculine role.

The military only hates feminine men (as they see them), they fucking love masculine women, so anyone looking to exist in a hyper-masculine environment to either feel more comfortable in, or ""fix"", the sack of meat they got poured into, need only to sign up.

Their version of Pro-Worker is probably giving workers more freedom to decide on employment conditions by eliminating wage laws, safety laws, hours laws etc.They want an employment agreement that I could *anything* and leave it to individuals to decide yes or know.

But we had that already. People died. Children died. Life expectancy was worse, people got crippled and couldn't work, pay was as low as unemployment rates allowed, people got sick and never figured out why, 8 hours becomes 12 then 14 with overtime, no power over schedules. People chose between ever worse conditions or starvation.

That's what is assume their Pro-Worker stance is. I'll now read the article and find out.

Edit: I wasn't even close. This is a welfare program to prop up birth rates for conservative households. In combination with denying abortion rights to women and lowering the standards for rape, sexual assault and marriage, they want to support the growth of white, christian conservative children.

He might not be smart enough to understand how that would work, but those that supported him on his first go around can see the benefit of having him in there again, so likely will fund more vote splitting candidates.

If Trump runs again, and she loses, she wins as she can tell him that she ran in service of him. If he doesn’t run again, she gets to build her grift machine and so in GOP terms, wins again.

10047,"The simple answer is to do away with algorithms that promote content. Let people browse and find what they want.

And, the easiest way to do that is to cut off all, and I mean all, data collection and correlation on users, since that's what fuels these algorithms. I block location, block ads as much as possible, and run all my internet services through a VPN, which I move the endpoint of daily. Google, Meta, Twitter, etc., know as little as possible about me.  The ads that do slip by are usually in languages I don't speak, so they're easy to ignore. 

I withold as much data as I can, but it's a constant war, and one I shouldn't have to be fighting.

Why do I feel strongly about this? First, I've always been advertising averse. I avoid it whenever possible because it's mostly just psychological manipulation and,I resent being manipulated. I chucked my TV over 30 years ago, only listen to listener supported college radio stations, and that cuts out a lot of it. 

My aversion to ads has been supported by life experiences. I've watched people chuck money at stupid things, buy stuff the never really wanted, and, on the more sinister side, in 2019 I saw an old friend go down the YouTube hole of QAnon videos and Trumpism, leading to him alienating friends, destroying relationships, assaulting a minor celebrity, ruining his career, and ultimately committing suicide.

I've watched my own parents get spun out on disinformation, and end up hospitalized with covid because they didn't want to get vaccinated, didn't want to wear masks, and so on. Fortunately they both survived, but my father now has heart damage he most likely wouldn't have had he followed scientific advice. The worst part is that he's not an idiot, he has a PhD in a hard science, and retired after decades of solid work in R&D and advanced technology industries. But, in age, he's become a Fox News fan.

So, disinformation can come in many ways, but it's almost always there to support marketing, to get eyes glued to ads. And now algorithms spin away, siphoning data from your every move, deciding what is most likely to keep you there, a deer frozen in headlights, staring blankly at what they feed you.

It's poisonous. It directly killed a friend of mine. Anyone can look around and see the corrosive and divisive effects it's having on society. 

Sure, every civilization has to fall at some point, eventually the American empire will be as long gone as the Roman one. But, we may be the first civilization to fall due to crappy marketing algorithms.

If we'd rather not go out like that, we have to kill it, right down to the root, and halt all user data siphoning by all platforms and devices.

I have personal experience with this, as my South African wife, who I've been married to for three years and has few ties to South Africa still isn't eligible for citizenship. The US makes citizenship a lengthy and difficult process, but to balance it out, green card holders have most of the same rights as a US citizen, with a few notable exceptions such as voting.

Musician Jean Michel Jarre, as part of his concert *Rendez-vous Houston* had planned to have Doctor McNair play a saxophone piece live from the shuttle. After the explosion Jarre initially wanted to cancel the event but was convinced to go on with it as a tribute to the crew. Houston's citizens, NASA, and even the families of those lost were apparently among those backing the idea.

A huge amount of people turned out to see the event, which included projecting films of JFK's ""We choose to go to the moon"" speech and Reagen's speech about the disaster on nearby skyscrapers. Doctor McNair's piece was played to video of him playing the sax on his first shuttle flight aboard *Challenger*.

Edit: Clarification of what I mean.

Adam Ellis (the artist in the post) goes to twitter and complains. He says that a filmmaker made a movie off of his comic, didnt give him credit, but asked Adam to promote the movie. Adam says stealing art is wrong.

Yanni, an artist who makes Prolific Pen Comics, then points out that Adam stole HIS work. He drops his art and compares it to Adams art. It is literally a shot for shot. The same faces, the same joke, the same words even. 

Adam then says ""Nope. I actually made this comic in 2012 for my old blog, The Book of Adam."" He drops a screenshot of the art as well as the date it was posted. 

Someone else then goes to Archive.org and can find absolutely zero evidence that the comic ever existed. It was never posted on the date that Adam claimed. Nothing was. Meaning that Adam made a quick sketch of the comic and faked a screenshot to stop criticism derailing his hypocritical whiny post.

tl;dr Adam is a shitass.

##What exactly is a ‘coregasm’?

`A coregasm is an orgasm that happens while you’re doing a core exercise or workout. When you engage your muscles to stabilize your core, you may also end up contracting the pelvic floor muscles that can be essential to achieving orgasm.
This may sound unusual, but scientists have recognized this occurrence since the 1950s. In medical literature, a “coregasm” is referred to as an exercise-induced orgasm (EIO) or exercise-induced sexual pleasure (EISP).
Keep reading to learn more about why coregasms happen and how to have one of your own`

##How does it happen?

`Scientists aren’t exactly sure why coregasms happen. The prevailing theory is that shaky, fatigued abdominal and pelvic floor muscles produce some type of inner stimulation that causes a coregasm. For men, this may be tied to prostate stimulation.
Given this, there probably isn’t a fixed pattern of muscle activation that can lead to coregasm. Your ability to coregasm may be determined by your anatomy, emotional state, and muscle strength at the time of your workout.
The exact way in which you move your body to perform each exercise may also affect your ability to coregasm`

##What does it feel like?

`For women, a coregasm feels similar to a deep vaginal orgasm — though it may not be as intense. Some women say it’s not as tingly.
You’ll most likely feel the sensation in your lower abdominals, inner thighs, or pelvis instead of a throbbing or quivering feeling in your clitoris.
For men, a coregasm may feel similar to a prostate orgasm. Prostate orgasms are said to last longer and be more intense. That’s because they can produce a continuous sensation instead of a pulsating one. This sensation may also expand throughout your body.
Ejaculation is also possible — even if your penis isn’t erect.`

##How to prevent a coregasm

`You may find that coregasms are awkward or uncomfortable. They may distract you from your workout or make you feel self-conscious, especially if you’re working out in public.
If you want to decrease your chances of having a coregasm, you should avoid any exercise that causes you to have one. And if you feel a coregasm coming on in the middle of your workout, gently come out of the exercise and move on to your next move. This should be enough to stop it from gaining intensity.
You may also find it helpful to focus on relaxing certain parts of your body when doing exercises known to cause a coregasm.`",1

It’s a doozy because they’ll have to either:

1.	Resort to mental gymnastics to excuse the TX venue shopping that could force SCOTUS to step in to protect their own legitimacy. 
2.	Agree that Kasmaryck’s willingness to take these cases without having them refiled in Austin creates the appearance of collusion on the part of his court, which has HUGE ramifications and potentially calls the impartiality of all three of those judges’ courts into question.

Basically, whether this motion succeeds or fails, it implies the judgment is tainted by bias and isn’t so much “fuel for the fire” on appeal as much as “lighting the string on fire and running before it gets to the powder keg.”

More importantly, it sets the expectation long before the judgment is received and can’t be waved away as just being a sore loser.",1

This applies to all things great and small. If you ask him what he had for breakfast that morning, his brain will tell him that his breakfast consisted of whatever he's decided makes him sound the best. It's basically an exercise in futility to parse out what a narcissist like him ""truly believes"" since his entire psyche is constructed around the idea of rendering the basic concept of objective reality meaningless.

This is why he makes no effort to keep his lies straight: he's not lying with the normal psychology of a liar, which is someone who knows what the truth is and says the other thing. He's lying with the psychology of someone for whom reality is wibbly-wobbly at best. Even when he says back-to-back things that are completely contradictory, his brain doesn't parse it as a contradiction. He said the truth the first time, and he said the truth the second time, and if you sense any contradiction, that's just evidence that you're unable to keep up with his perfect brain and that shit's on you.",1

They see our existence as inherently sexual, and our clothing and gender presentation as the expression of a perverse fetish. If we are anywhere in public where a child might possibly see us, even if it's standing in line at the 7-11, they are claiming that this is pedophilic grooming through forcibly exposing children to degenerate sexual activity.

Military leadership has a history of being a bit behind the times and leaning a bit religious or conservative but it also requires a college education to become an officer. College and service around the world are a great way to grow empathy for people who are not like you.

10596,"From the article:

>In 2006, Mexico declared war against drug traffickers in the wake of escalating inter-cartel warfare. Since then, there have been more than 300,000 murders in the country, a death toll escalated by violence between law enforcement, the military and the cartels. An official list of the missing has risen to over 100,000 people, called los desaparecidos—the disappeared. Many of them are presumably among the ­­roughly 52,000 unidentified bodies in Mexican morgues. The disappeared are, legally speaking, neither alive nor dead; they include people whose remains are undiscovered or unidentified, and others who may be still alive and held in captivity.  
>  
>In 2021 and 2022, with the No Están Solas project, I worked with Mexican human rights advocates who were trying to locate and identify the remains of some of the disappeared. I learned the crisis in Mexico is one with many faces: cartel violence, forced migration, and clashes between the Mexican government, its people and the drug traffickers who offer jobs, protection and resources, often through coercion.  
>  
>I believe the violence will worsen if we do not address a powerful new factor: climate change and its effect on Mexico’s water supply. Changing weather patterns, the failure of government institutions to accommodate growing and moving populations, and the realities of decaying infrastructure are reducing the availability of usable fresh water in several parts of Mexico. This, I believe, is adding to crime, civil unrest and migration, as people search for more habitable or safer ground.  
>  
>In the first half of 2021 Mexico had an average rain shortfall of 20 percent, and by 2022 several states experienced shortfalls greater than 90 percent  compared to expected levels. The loss of rainfall is putting greater stress on already overexploited aquifers and depleted reservoirs. To make matters worse, the government has mismanaged the water supply, failing to crack down on illegal pumping by cartels and farmers, and preferentially allotting scarce public water supplies to large companies. This has inflamed the water crisis and caused the brunt of drought to be endured by Mexico’s poorer and marginalized communities.  
>  
>From what I’ve seen, I believe that climate change will increasingly lead to the kind of violence that has defined the country’s drug war, much in the same way researchers have linked climate change to the Syrian Civil War. And here is where I think the U.S. can make a difference.  The U.S. government has committed billions of dollars in aid to a war on drugs that has failed, with drug seizures at the US-Mexico border remaining high and drug-war related murders soaring since 2006. If the United States reallocated some of its drug war funding from militarized aid and law enforcement to water collection and distribution projects, this could reduce water’s role as a driver of violence and displacement.",-1

Between January 1 and August 31, 2022, ALA documented 681 attempts to ban or restrict library resources, and 1,651 unique titles were targeted. In 2021, ALA reported 729 attempts to censor library resources, targeting 1,597 books, which represented the highest number of attempted book bans since ALA began compiling these lists more than 20 years ago.

**Additionally, more than 70 percent of the 681 attempts to restrict library resources targeted multiple titles. In the past, the vast majority of challenges to library resources only sought to remove or restrict a single book.**

""'The unprecedented number of challenges we’re seeing already this year reflects coordinated, national efforts to silence marginalized or historically underrepresented voices and deprive all of us – young people, in particular – of the chance to explore a world beyond the confines of personal experience,' said ALA President Lessa Kananiʻopua Pelayo-Lozada.

'Librarians develop collections and resources that make knowledge and ideas widely available, so people and families are free to choose what to read. Though it’s natural that we want to protect young people from some of life’s more difficult realities, the truth is that banning books does nothing to protect them from dealing with tough issues. Instead, it denies young people resources that can help them deal with the challenges that confront them.

**'Efforts to censor entire categories of books reflecting certain voices and views shows that the moral panic isn’t about kids: it’s about politics. Organizations with a political agenda are spreading lists of books they don’t like.**

'Library professionals trust individuals to make their own decisions about what they read and believe. ALA and our partners in the Unite Against Book Bans campaign are asking readers everywhere to stand with us in the fight against censorship.'""

>When Trump says he plans to ""master the Democrats' own game of harvesting ballots"" that's what he's talking about. And it's almost certainly what many of his followers will hear.

>***Vote by mail and early voting has been free of any kind of systemic fraud until now. It looks like Trump is looking to change that.*** 

>60% of GOP voters still believe the Democrats stole the 2020 election. His job done, Trump is now switching gears and this week endorsed mail-in voting.

>Trump has said many times that he believes all counting should stop at midnight on election night as if any votes counted later are automatically suspect.

>Some states have been doing vote by mail for years and the practice was being used in other places in 2020 because we were all being cautious due to the fact there was a deadly pandemic killing thousands of people every day. Trump never cared about that but cleverly set up vote-by-mail as a ready-made excuse in case he lost.

>when asked at a press conference before the election ***if he would allow the peaceful transfer of power*** if he lost, Trump said, ""we're going to have to see what happens ...get rid of the ballots and there will be a very peaceful … continuation of power. We all know what happened.

>All of Trump's silly, reckless claims were nonsense both before and after the election. He lost over 60 election lawsuits but he relentlessly pushed the Big Lie for two solid years, pounding it over and over again until ***it became an article of faith*** among most Republicans that the election had been stolen by the Democrats.


>Trump premiered the movie ""2000 Mules"" at Mar-a-Lago and praised it to the heavens. It is a propaganda film by convicted felon and GOP operative Dinesh D'Souza that claims Democratic ballot ""mules"" were paid to illegally collect and drop off ballots in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, resulting in Biden's win.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is demanding Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) to name a new treasurer for his campaign and several affiliated political committees, warning that a failure to do so will bar the groups from raising or spending any money.

“It is required that for any committee to conduct any business, they must have an active treasurer,” Jaime Amrhein, an assistant branch chief at the FEC, wrote in a Tuesday letter to Santos’s campaign. “Failure to appoint a treasurer will result in the inability of the committee to accept contributions and make disbursements.”

Santos’s now-former campaign treasurer Nancy Marks resigned her role last month amid questions about the campaign’s finances. The campaign filed paperwork naming longtime GOP operative Thomas Datwyler as its new treasurer, but shortly after, a lawyer for Datwyler told The Hill that he had not agreed to take the job. 

Federal law requires every political committee to have a treasurer in order to spend or take in money. Campaigns must appoint a new treasurer within 10 days of their former treasurers resigning. The letter from the FEC gives Santos’s campaign until March 21 to respond.",-1

>Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan, is a medication that has been used for decades to quickly reverse the effects of an overdose from opioids, including prescription painkillers, as well as heroin and fentanyl. In November, the FDA asked drug companies that make naloxone to apply for over-the-counter approval.

>Committee members said the move would save lives.

>“For the sake of the public and saving lives, I believe this medication should be available over the counter as soon as possible,” Dr. Katalin Roth, a professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, said following the vote.

Having this around and easily available saves lives.  I only hope that it's actually affordable OTC.",1

It’s not about age of consent, it’s about power dynamics. It doesn’t matter if it’s a famous actor and a model or your next door neighbor, dating someone this much younger who hasn’t been an adult that long is slightly predatory, especially when it’s an older man and younger woman (but also to a lesser extent older woman-younger man). 18 is just an arbitrary number, and a 19 year old isn’t much better equipped to handle life and make difficult decisions than a 15 year old, hence why they can’t do things like drink or rent a car and are generally expected by society to continue being dumb asses for a few more years. 18 is the age where we have collectively agreed that is time for young people to start figuring life out and so they must be given the legal freedom to try, but no one expects them to figure things out for another 3-8 years. This collective understanding is why it makes people so uncomfortable when someone older and in a position of power dates someone so young, because that young person hasn’t really figured shit out yet and can be easily taken advantage of. And if you can’t grasp this, it means you belong to the subset of people who never figured their shit out and are emotionally and mentally stuck at around 20, like Leo probably is.",-1

Burra, convicted drug dealer and pure MAGA swamp monster was the IT ""brains"" behind the dissemination of the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop back when he was working as a producer on Steve Bannon's podcastBurra went on to work as a staffer for Matt Gaetz but left when the underage sex scandal surrounding Gaetz started to die off because, as Burra states it, **""If the FBI and the DOJ are no longer coming after you, it’s not a fun job any more""**

Burra took on the role of Director of Operations for Santos in January, *after* the public started learning about Santos' shady past. When asked if Santos' lies and concerns around his campaign finances was what drew Burra to want to work for Santos he said **""Of course, that's my brand""**. Burra describes what he does as **""activism and institutional infiltration""** and says his operational style is **“two katanas to the neck”**

Burra, in partnership with Gavin Wax, got his start in politics with a takeover of the New York Young Republican Club, turning it into a proto-fascist network with links to a roll call of US and foreign far-right groups. The aims of Burra's inner circle were well stated by Wax at an NYYRC event when he said **""We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.""**

Burra is the worst of the worst when it comes to GOP culture war warriors.

Ducks have, hum, penises with certain uncommon characteristics. They are corkscrew shaped, and covered in small barbs and hooks. Female ducks in turn have evolved vaginas that spiral in the opposite direction, full of pouches and dead ends that make insemination as hard as duckingly possible in a genital evolutionary arms race. Now, duck penises are sized in proportion to the amount of potential mates available that season. Do they grow and shrink, you ask? They don't! Once the duck is done using its disgusting meaty spiral, it simply falls off and grow again next mating season.

So, if you want duck mayonnaise, you'll need to find one in the right moment of the year and bring a spiral-shape recipient, and be cautious with the spikes. Maybe if you take one from the ground you can squeeze the last drops, like a tooth paste tube? Either way, bon appétit!",-1
